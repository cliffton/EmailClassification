# Email Classification using Parallel Computing


This project is an email classifier that uses k-NN statistical analysis to classify emails as spam or ham. It uses the Parallel Java 2 library to run the analysis in parallel thus increasing throughput. The dataset used is the [enron email dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/) which contains 0.5 million email records.
