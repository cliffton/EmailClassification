 cbpres austin rr com  to   phillip allen   pallen enron com  cc   larry lewter   retwell mail sanmarcos net    claudia l  crocker   clclegal2 aol com  subject  investment structure structure  typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate  or llc  general partner   the general partner owns 1  of the project and carries the liability of construction  land ownership   loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans  land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership   each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans   if the investor s  do not sign on the loans  this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced  all loans for residential construction  that are intended for re sale  are full recourse loans   if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments  the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit  engineering   architectural design  soils tests  surveys  filing fees  legal fees for organization and condominium association formation   and appraisals   unlike many real estate investment programs  none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders  llc   these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period  early land costs the  4 000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing   as an alternative  we can close into a land loan at probably 70  of appraised value   with a land value equal to the purchase price of  680 000 this would mean a land loan of  476 000 with estimated monthly interest payments of  3 966  given a 10  annual interest rate  plus approximately 1 25  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin  the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements  referred to as the  fiscals    this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa   this release will be for 90  of the cost with the remaining 10  released one year after completion   releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction   these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit   as such  they have to be counted as a development cost  even though they are not spent   because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds  the lot improvement loan is typically 75  of the appraised value of a finished lot  which i suspect will be at least  20 000 and potentially as high as  25 000   this would produce a loan amount of   15 000 on  20 000 per lot   with estimated per lot improvement costs of  9 000   fiscals  at  2 000 and the land cost at  8 000   total improved lot cost is  19 000 which means  0 to  4 000 per lot in total equity   the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs   thus  the additional equity for the improvement loan would be  0  184 000    even if the maximum loan would cover all costs  it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side   the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing  which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement  phasing works as follows   if the first phase was say 40 units  the total lot improvement cost might average  31 000 per lot    of this  probably  13 000 would be for improvements and  19 000 for the land cost   the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs  the entry road  water treatment costs  perimeter fencing and landscaping  and so on  as well as for 100  of the land   the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70  of the appraised raw lot value  which i would estimate as  10 000 per lot for a loan value of  7 000 per lot   then the loan value for each improved lot would be  15 000 per lot   this would give you a total loan of  992 000  total cost of  1 232 645 for equity required of  241 000   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans   first  is a speculative  spec  loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity   second   is a construction loan for a pre sold unit  but the loan remains in the builder developers name   third  is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer   we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer   we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers  as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process  spec loans will be for 70  to 75  of value and construction loans for pre sold units  if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender   will be from 80  to 95  of value  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs  then to necessary reserves  then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement   the general partner will contract with creekside builders  llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15  of the direct hard cost excluding land  financing and sales costs  these fees are the only monies to creekside  larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit  except for a  direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b  direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform   for example  if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub  or cannot find enough trim carpenters  etc   and it decides to undertake this function  it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership  finally  cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others   at present cb does not own any significant equipment  but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing  cornice  roofing and drywall spreading  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs  plan  what did you have in mind   i would like to use some form of internet based reporting  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question   bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses    please expand  investor input we are glad to have the investor s input on design and materials   as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement  but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus  as you  and i presume keith  want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs  vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates   in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible   for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport   finally  for vendors they are constantly shopped  pre selected professionals  subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested  i know i have not answered everything  but this is a starting point   call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further  sincerely  george richards president  creekside builders  llc   winmail dat
