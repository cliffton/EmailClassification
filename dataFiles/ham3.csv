26,0,  all else being equal  the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the  square root of air density air density drops off pretty quickly  and i  really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that i  think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of  the atmosphere trails off chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity  resulting in the potential energy for a mass m to be linear in height h mgh what relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium if they are at the same height  we will have half the mass in one  and half the mass in the other  and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction0 if they are at differing heights  then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends  in order for the two flows to balance  the higher packet must contain less air than the lower  and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly high percentage of thin air  low percentage of dense air now  rates are exponential in energy differences1  so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height  to compensate  how does it go in practice dave 0 how well does it balance chemical equilibria seem stable  as they deal with very large numbers over a very long time  economic equilibria are viewed from the mayfly standpoint of individual people  and so  at best  the shot noise is very visible 1 that is to say  rates will be exponential in the free energy differences between endpoints and a transition state  we can ignore that complication in this model

user 5the programming language as work environment 6acquiring a sense of elegance 7references the value of analogies programming language design is a comparatively new activity  it has existed for less than half a century  so it is often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity thus  my book principles of programming languages design  evaluation  and implementation  grew out of a study of teaching methods in architecture  primarily  but also of pedagogy in other disciplines  such as aircraft design perhaps you have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars fortran  model t  c  dune buggy  etc these analogies can be very informative  and can serve as intuition pumps to enhance our creativity  but they cannot be used uncritically because they are  in the end  just analogies ultimately our design decisions must be based on more than analogies  since analogies can be misleading as well as informative in this essay ill address the role of aesthetics in programming language design  but i will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering  the tower and the bridge  by david p billington although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages  we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly according to billington  there are three values common to many technological activities  which we can call the three es efficiency  economy and elegance these values correspond to three dimensions of technology  which billington calls the scientific  social and symbolic dimensions the three ss we will consider each in turn efficiency seeks to minimize resources used in structural engineering  efficiency deals with the amount of material used the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific strength of materials  disposition of forces  etc similarly  in programming language design  efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources there are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design some are reviewed in my principles of programming languages in the early days  the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time  although compiletime resource utilization was also relevant in other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time  and there are wellknown cases in which this compromised safety eg fortrans implicit declarations there are also many wellknown cases in which security ie safety was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking eg array bounds checking efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time  but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges compile time is not interchangeable run time  and neither one is the same as programmer time similarly  computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator  such as money  but this brings in economic considerations  to which we now turn economy seeks to maximize benefit versus cost whereas efficiency is a scientific issue  economy is a social issue in structural engineering  economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost this is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public in programming language design  the public that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict for example  the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time  the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs  and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include whether major manufacturers support the language  whether prestigious universities teach it  whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations such as the us department of defense  whether it has been standardized  whether it comes to be perceived as a real language used by real programmers or as a toy language used by novices or dilettantes  and so forth as can be seen from the historical remarks in my principles  social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money  but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces also  many social issues  from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures  are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost all kinds of cost and benefit must be considered in seeking an economical design elegance symbolizes good design elegance who cares about elegance snorts the hardnosed engineer  but billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in hardnosed engineering for the designer it is wellknown that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language see my principles for examples structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity  but billington observes that the best designers dont make extensive use of computer models and calculation one reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete the engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not  and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well also  equations are often simplified eg  made linear to make their analysis feasible  and this is another potential source of error because of these limitations  engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost ie decreased efficiency and economy similarly in programming language design  the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an underengineered design  in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions  and an overengineered design  in which we have confidence  but which is inefficient or uneconomical many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the fourmonthold tacoma narrows bridge it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design billington explains that this accident  along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures  was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s however  the very problem that destroyed the tacoma narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles according to billington  the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis although they do not abandon it altogether rather  their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance this is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined  that is  there are many possible solutions to a particular problem  such as bridging a particular river therefore  expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see the design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced  and the design looks stable if it is stable the general principle is that designs that look good will also be good  and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive but incomplete mathematical analysis billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that  in structural design  function follows form he adds p 21  when the form is well chosen  its analysis becomes astoundingly simple in other words  the choice of form is open and free  so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design ie efficient and economical design if we do so  then we can let aesthetics guide design the same applies to programming language design by restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest  in which good interactions look good  and bad interactions look bad  we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design  without having to check all the possible interactions for the user in this case  whats good for the designer also is good for the user nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment  and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may explode if combined in the wrong way the manifest balance of forces in a welldesigned bridge gives us confidence when we cross it so also  the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it  because we have welljustified confidence in the consequences of our actions we accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade when the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed  and collapses  it wont much matter that it was beautiful on the outside so also in programming languages if the elegance is only superficial  that is  if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design  then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their unwarranted confidence in summary  good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good as a consequence  these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense  as can the users of the structures bridges or programming languages they design we may miss out on some good designs this way  but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs we may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my principles of programming languages the elegance principle confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good the programming language as work environment there are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a wellengineered programming language the programming language is something the professional programmer will live with  even live in it should feel comfortable and safe  like a welldesigned home or office in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop a programming language should be a joy to use this will encourage its use and decrease the programmers fatigue and frustration the programming language should not be a hindrance  but should serve more as a collaborator  encouraging programmers to do their jobs better as some automobiles are driving machines and work as a natural extension of the driver  so a programming language should be a programming machine by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso the programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant  efficient and economical programs through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values for example  in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess  sparing economy or asceticism the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication  downtoearth practicality or ignorant crudeness thus a programming language can promote a set of values by embodying certain values  it encourages us to think about them by neglecting or negating other values  it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention out of sight  out of mind acquiring a sense of elegance aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach  so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design  which  especially in europe  is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers because of it  structural engineers design many more bridges than they build  and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers the public also critiques the competing designs  and in this way becomes more educated their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers so also  to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages  design obsessively  and criticize  revise and discard your designs you should also evaluate and criticize other peoples designs and try to improve them in this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the real thing comes

bliss big business in thailand thu aug 29 1019 am et by andrew marshall bangkok  thailand reuters  english dentist ken moylan came to thailand looking for a wife it took two hours to find her the first day i went out with wan  she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room i thought it was marvelous  he said i knew then there was something special moylan  49  is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet  and marry  thai women he lives in england now with 28yearold wan  who is expecting their first child critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries  offering dreams of a new life in the west that often turn sour but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand in search of a wife i got to thailand at 2 pm  and by 4 pm id met wan  he said i knew i found her attractive i could tell straight away that she was very caring moylan spent a week in thailand  and after returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail six months later she came to england and the couple married mr marriage lawrence lynch  49  runs thai professional introduction services  the agency moylan used to meet his wife lynch  who calls himself mr marriage  started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages in the last five years weve done about 400  he said to the best of my knowledge  they have all been successful male clients pay 2 213 for the service  although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband if they like what they see they come to bangkok clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynchs office  encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies  lynch said but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax after the first meeting  couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better within two weeks of arrival  lynch says  almost every client has found a potential wife at the end of a fortnight its very  very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasnt made his mind up  he said in most cases  marriage follows  usually within the next year roongthip kamchat  managing director of thai no 1 connections  a bangkokbased agency  says she has introduced about 1 000 couples  and less than 10 percent have broken up roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in bangkok looking for a wife sometimes they are very nervous  she said and sometimes they are very impatient and say give me a lady  i want to get married now i say calm down  ok  well talk but if men are really in a hurry  roongthip says  she can find them a wife and get them married within a week lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man  a man with one leg and a man with posttraumatic stress disorder why similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country  and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy  there is no reason to object if you talk about people who are needy  i think everybody wants someone to love them  and wants someone to love  so yes  i need wan  he said thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand i think theres no secret there they are looking for a better life i dont have a problem with that in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too  and that is why they choose to use his agency his brochure promises an alternative to the kind of defeminized  oversized  selfcentered  mercenaryminded lady available on the british singles scene  and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not gods gift to women roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries  and found thai women attractive they dont know how to meet women even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores  how can they ask people to marry them impossible  she said many thai girls are slim  have long hair  black eyes  small nose they are good at taking care and joking and laughing  not strict different from ladies from other countries although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap  the agencies say this is not a problem they say language problems are also not a major obstacle thai ladies are not ageist  and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older  lynch said when i met my wife she couldnt speak a word of english we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west we have kitchens  we have study classes  roongthip said we teach them how to eat  and when to make tea pitfalls but not all dreams come true bee is a 26yearold thai woman who went to switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency now she is back in bangkok  sad and angry he had no friends  and i was so lonely  she said i tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean he never spoke to me bee came back to bangkok earlier this year i thought i would be happy there  she said but it was the worst time of my life lynch says that while some agencies are badly run  he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out we are ethical and professional  he said we will not take on all comers moylan says that despite possible pitfalls  his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work wans sister has just signed up with lynchs company  looking for a foreign husband perhaps there are cases of women being exploited im sure there are  moylan said but in the majority of cases the women get a good deal

117,0, begin pgp signed message hash sha1 at 1115 am 0400 on 92202  geege schuman wrote  most of them seem to have ivy league educations  or are ivy league  dropouts suggesting to me that they werent exactly poor to start  with actually  if i remember correctly from discussion of the lists composition in forbes about five or six years ago  the best way to get on the forbes 400 is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps  boys and girls i knew you could given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school  like  say  mine    is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a governmentrun high school  youll probably get more of those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing transferpayment depression an economic version of this summers governmentforest conflagration  caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this summer  that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out there  including me    to learn to actually feed themselves the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a terminal professional degree  like an mba  phd  md  etc  from the best school possible why because  as of about 1950  the best way to get into harvard  for instance  is to be smart  not rich dont take my word for it  ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof meritocracy  american style  was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint    and  of course  chicago taught them all how  right  practically nobody who goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless  of course  their parents  who couldnt afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so and their kids still had to get the grades  and biased by intelligence   test scores  to get in the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees  until they actually own something and hire people  or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people who dont work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone is smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow btw  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that im using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri  and i dont have a degree in anything actually useful  much less a terminal one  which means im broker than anyone on this list  its just that you  of all people  lots with educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and economics is not a zerosum game the cost of anything  including ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case  intelligence and effort i will  however  admit to being educated waay past my level of competence  and  by the way you discuss economics  so have you  apparently btw  if we ever actually had free markets in this country  including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes  all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money  and there would be more selfmade people on that list in addition  most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it  not even relatively speaking finally  practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else  investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress  for those of you in the peoples republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff  cheaper  over time  a terrible  petitbourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite  or youd know about it by now in economic terms  its also called an increase in general welfare  and  no  virginia  im not talking about extorting money from someone who works  and giving it to someone who doesnt in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time in short  then  economics is not a zero sum game  property is not theft  the rich dont get rich off the backs of the poor  and redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit  happy or otherwise to believe otherwise  is  quite literally  given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense cheers  rah begin pgp signature version pgp 75 iqaawubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur yybocicylp5tlkl58jpwefu z877 end pgp signature   r a hettinga mailto

129,0, httpwwwguardiancoukreligionstory0 2763 806744 00html evangelicals threat to new archbishop direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality stephen bates  religious affairs correspondent tuesday october 8  2002 the guardian evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust rowan williams  the incoming archbishop of canterbury  before he even takes up his post  by threatening to take direct action against him the council of the church society  the church of englands oldest evangelical body  joined a younger evangelical pressure group called reform  which is also opposed to dr williams  in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down following an emergency meeting  the 167yearold society  whose leaders met the archbishop last week  proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all anglicans to spurn him the move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop  whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement some evangelicals object to dr williamss acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest  something many bishops have done  and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned the new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church nevertheless  the society said it is clear that he prefers his private judgment to the voice of scripture  to the voice of tradition and to the common mind of the church as such he can only be a focus of disunity the council called upon loyal anglicans to pray specifically that rowan williams would see the error in his teaching  change his views or stand down  it said the society claimed to have drawn up an action plan  including calling on bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide anglican communion  of which archbishops of canterbury are the leaders  to distance themselves from dr williamss doctrinal and ethical position it promised it would be taking steps towards appropriate direct action it added that dr williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called theology and sexuality which  six months ago  published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour despite its claim  the society does not represent the common mind of the church dr williams  currently archbishop of wales  was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members  including evangelicals  and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the queen he is due to succeed george carey  who retires this month  and will be formally enthroned at canterbury cathedral in february asked what form direct action might take  the rev george curry  the societys chairman  said watch this space presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where dr williams is present church of england bishops  who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row  are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists challenge  which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal a letter by senior theologians in todays guardian  however  repudiates the evangelicals tactics  calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching on the bbcs thought for the day yesterday  angela tilby  viceprincipal of westcott house  cambridge  accused dr williamss opponents of presumption and blackmail it is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave it is attempting to force an issue by emotional violence manipulating to get your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation  she said last week  dr williams said he was deeply saddened matters of sexuality should not have the priority or centrality that reform and the church society have tried to give them the archbishop cannot withdraw his appointment since so many  including evangelicals  have urged him to take the post the archbishop believes it to be his duty under god  yahoo groups sponsor  sell a home with ease httpusclickyahoocomsrpzmcktmeaamvfiaa7gsolbtm  to unsubscribe from this group  send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom  your use of yahoo groups is subject to httpdocsyahoocominfoterms

157,0, of course weve had select since bsd 42 and poll since system v or so  and they work reasonably well for asynchronous io up to a hundred or so channels  but suck after that devpoll available in solaris and linux is one approach to solving this linux has a way to do essentially the same thing with realtime signals  and has for years and freebsd has kqueue more details about these are at httpwwwcitiumicheduprojectslinuxscalability none of this helps with disk io most programs that need to overlap disk io with computation  on either proprietary unixes or linux  just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk io posix specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk io that most proprietary unixes implement  the linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting linuxs entire io subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously  because they can easily build efficient synchronous io primitives from asynchronous ones  but not the other way around so now linux will support this mechanism too it probably doesnt need saying for anyone whos read beberg saying things like memory management is a nonissue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions  but hes totally offbase people should know by now not to take anything he says seriously  but apparently some dont  so ill rebut not surprisingly  the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors in detail  he wrote  could it be after 20 years without this feature unix finally  catches up to windows and has io that doesnt sic totally suck for  nontrivial apps no way unix acquired nonblocking io in the form of select about 23 years ago  and solaris has had the particular aio calls we are discussing for many years  very few applications need the aio calls  essentially only highperformance rdbms servers even benefit from them at all  and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes  this just provides a modicum of extra performance  ok  so they do it with signals or a flag  which is completely  ghetto  but at least they are trying keep trying guys  you got the  idea  but not the clue readers can judge who lacks the clue here  the windows io model does definately sic blow the doors off the  unix one  but then they had select to point at in its sic  suckiness and anything would have been an improvement unix is just  now looking at its sic io model and adapting to a multiprocess  multithreaded world so its gonna be years yet before a posix api  comes out of it although i dont have a copy of the spec handy  i think the aio apis come from the posix spec ieee std 100311990  section 679  which is 13 years old  and which i think documented thencurrent practice they might be even older than that unix has been multiprocess since 1969  and most unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more  bottom line is the do stuff when something happens model turned  out to be right  and the unix look for something to do and keep  looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look  is not really working so great anymore linuxs aio routines can notify the process of their completion with a signal  a feature missing in microsoft windows a signal causes the immediate execution of a signal handler in a process  by contrast  the microsoft windows mechanisms to do similar things such as completion ports do not deliver a notification until the process polls them i dont think signals are a better way to do things in this case although i havent written any rdbmses myself  but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards most programs that use linux realtime signals for asynchronous network io  in fact  block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very windowsish way  using sigtimedwait or sigwaitinfo  kragenpoboxcom       kragen sitaker     httpwwwpoboxcomkragen edsger wybe dijkstra died in august of 2002  this is a terrible loss after which the world will never be the same httpwwwxentcompipermailfork2002august013974html

213,0, anyone who doesnt appreciate both pluck and luck is only looking at part of the equation america has  in fact  moved hard toward meritocracy  but  and this is a huge one  you dont necessarily find it on the forbes list  there is an element of luck  even if only being in the right place at the right time  to go that high beyond the forbes list  there are many ways in which almost pure luck is involved in significant wealth  being a supermodel  for example though i think most people would be surprised by a lot of supermodels cindy crawford was valedictorian of her high school most people  of course  arent in those stratified realms  it is the rest of us who tend to sort there is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of merit in the first place  rawls claims merit doesnt exist  sowell seems to agree at least in part  but im sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring  iq  purity of heart  or the ability to satisfy customers  functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart  yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list  or even just being a garden variety millionaire next door is more likely to be the serving customers definition differences due to merit  when they are perceived as such  generate far more animosity than differences due to luck  luck can be forgiven superior performance  often not  original message  from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on

dropouts suggesting to me that they werent exactly poor to start   with   actually  if i remember correctly from discussion of the lists  composition in forbes about five or six years ago  the best way to  get on the forbes 400 is to have no college at all can you say  bootstraps  boys and girls i knew you could   given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school   like  say  mine    is nothing but stuff they should have taught  you in a governmentrun high school  youll probably get more of  those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on if we ever get  around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing  transferpayment depression an economic version of this summers  governmentforest conflagration  caused by the same kind of  innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this  summer  that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out  there  including me    to learn to actually feed themselves    the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a  terminal professional degree  like an mba  phd  md  etc  from the  best school possible   why because  as of about 1950  the best way to get into harvard   for instance  is to be smart  not rich dont take my word for it   ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the  years for proof   meritocracy  american style  was invented at the ivy league after  world war ii even stanford got the hint    and  of course   chicago taught them all how  right  practically nobody who  goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually  afford to go there these days unless  of course  their parents  who  couldnt afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the  last 40 years or so and their kids still had to get the grades   and biased by intelligence   test scores  to get in    the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal  degrees  until they actually own something and hire people  or  learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss  basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after  death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people  who dont work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone is  smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow   btw  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this  rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that im using it to  beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you  were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end i went to  missouri  and i dont have a degree in anything actually useful   much less a terminal one  which means im broker than anyone on  this list  its just that you  of all people  lots with  educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better the  facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and look  there are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and  economics is not a zerosum game the cost of anything  including  ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case   intelligence and effort   i will  however  admit to being educated waay past my level of  competence  and  by the way you discuss economics  so have you   apparently     btw  if we ever actually had free markets in this country   including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes   all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money  and  there would be more selfmade people on that list in addition   most of the people who inherited money on the list would have  much less of it  not even relatively speaking finally  practically  all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and  not stolen from someone else  investment bubbles or not   that efficiency is called progress  for those of you in the  peoples republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better  stuff  cheaper  over time  a terrible  petitbourgeois concept  apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite  or youd  know about it by now in economic terms  its also called an increase  in general welfare  and  no  virginia  im not talking about  extorting money from someone who works  and giving it to someone who  doesnt in order to keep them from working and they can think of some  politician as santa claus come election time    in short  then  economics is not a zero sum game  property is not  theft  the rich dont get rich off the backs of the poor  and  redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just  that horseshit  happy or otherwise   to

use introduction agencies to meet alb  and marry  thai women he lives in england now with 28yearold wan  alb who is expecting their first child alb critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women alb in developing countries  offering dreams of a new life in the west that alb often turn sour but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand alb in search of a wife alb i got to thailand at 2 pm  and by 4 pm id met wan  he said i knew i alb found her attractive i could tell straight away that she was very caring alb moylan spent a week in thailand  and after

since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages alb in the last five years weve done about 400  he said to the best of my alb knowledge  they have all been successful alb male clients pay 2 213 for the service  although men from countries that alb require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount alb clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women alb looking for a husband if they like what they see they come to bangkok alb clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynchs alb office  encounters that can often be

alb after the first meeting  couples can decide to go on dates to get to know alb each other better within two weeks of arrival  lynch says  almost every alb client has found a potential wife alb at

alb say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to alb form relationships in their own country  and on the desperation of alb impoverished women who believe they can find a

261,0, martin  yes  confirming what i said in my last message ah i see where the problem  lies you seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that zimbabwe and  zambia are the same country  no  that would be rather silly there are conflicting reports on whether zambia is prepared to accept milled gm grain or not  and  from reports from various sources  considerable debate within that country theres complex issues  not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty environmentalists  which was my original point timc  yahoo groups sponsor  4 dvds free sp join now httpusclickyahoocompt6ybbnxieaamvfiaa7gsolbtm  to unsubscribe from this group  send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom  your use of yahoo groups is subject to httpdocsyahoocominfoterms

281,0,  dunno about the other tools  but spamassassin is a breeze to incorporate  into a procmail environment  lots of people use it in many other ways  for  performance reasons  many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small  c program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the  result back out  i think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast  enough to not require such tricks though i would consider changing the  pickle to an anydbm file   basic procmail usage goes something like this       0fw       spamassassin p       0       xspamstatus yes      spam   which just says  run spamassassin p reinjecting its output into the  processing stream  if the resulting mail has a header which begins  xspamstatus yes  toss it into the folder indicated by the variable  spam   spamassassin also adds other headers as well  which give you more detail  about how its tests fared  id like to see spambayes operate in at least  this way do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set  of headers which further processing downstream can key on do you feel capable of writing such a tool  it doesnt look too hard guido van rossum home page httpwwwpythonorgguido

290,0, guys  the habeas infringers list hil exists explicitly to deal with spammers while were getting judgments against them and especially in other countries  where those judgments are harder to get please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers  yes  some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes  and isps have won some theft of service suits  but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles  so  i cant understand how daniel can assert that you cant track spammers down when its never really been tried  we can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of  we can subpoena the records of the isp that provided them service  and of the credit card they used for the whackamole accounts  we can use private investigators  yes  these people are often lowlifes chickenboners  but  theyre not secret agents  theyre just trying to make a buck  and habeas whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers that use our warrant mark in a way that no one ever has had before  given that our whole business plan relies on habeas becoming synonymous with not spam  i cant understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful  plan for that failure  and in so doing  remove the potential of success  which is antispam filters like sa acting on the habeas warrant mark daniel  its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all violators on the hil  then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release  but  youre trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise at the end of the day  spamassassin is like the club  in that it encourages thieves spammers to just go after the next car those without sa rather than yours  habeas can play the role of lojack the transmitter  in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they dont steal any more cars  but only if were given a chance to succeed  dan  dan kohn mailtodandankohncom httpwwwdankohncom  tel16503272600 original message from daniel quinlan mailtoquinlanpathnamecom sent wednesday  august 28  2002 1638 to matthew cline cc spamassassintalkexamplesourceforgenet subject re satalk ot habeus  why matthew cline mattnightrealmscom writes  there must be some way of tracking a spammer down  since they are  planning on making money from the spam  what a court would consider  evidence of being the spammer is another question haha just a few notes  it will be difficult to find  prosecute  and win money from someone in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a good example even if they do officially respect copyright law  law suits take time between now and conclusion of the first court case  we could have years of spam in our mail boxes  contact information can change phone numbers  po boxes  stolen cell phones  temporary email addresses  etc  spammers do not always remember to include contact information  i dont understand it either  but nobody said they were bright  also  some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty for example  pump and dump stock scams  so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way dan  this sfnet email is sponsored by jabber  the worlds fastest growing realtime communications platform dont just im build it in httpwwwjabbercomosdnxim  spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet httpslistssourceforgenetlistslistinfospamassassintalk  this sfnet email is sponsored by jabber  the worlds fastest growing realtime communications platform dont just im build it in httpwwwjabbercomosdnxim  spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet httpslistssourceforgenetlistslistinfospamassassintalk

private money paid for these bits  but expropriation may be fairer for ip than realp rohit kharealumnicaltechedu vast detail on towers collapse may be sealed september 30  2002 by james glanz and eric lipton  what is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the world trade center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in lower manhattan amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center  the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nations most respected engineering minds it includes computer calculations that have produced a series of threedimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit  helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses an immense body of documentary evidence  like maps of the debris piles  rare photos and videos  has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings but everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information  which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved  may remain buried in sealed files  or even destroyed bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients  the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation and as it now stands  the judge in the case  who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being  has approved standard legal arrangements that  should the lawsuit be settled before trial  could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld were obviously in favor of releasing the information  but we cant until were told what to do  said matthys levy  an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates  who is a consultant in the case and the author of why buildings fall down how structures fail norton  2nd edition  2002 lets just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process of the collapse  mr levy said monica gabrielle  who lost her husband  richard  when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign  said the information should be disclosed if they have answers and are not going to share them  i would be devastated  mrs gabrielle said they have a moral obligation the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a silverstein  whose companies own a lease on the trade center property  and a consortium of insurance companies mr silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack  entitling him to some 7 billion  rather than half that amount  as the insurance companies say as both sides have prepared their arguments  they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers dean davison  a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford  one of the insurance companies in the suit  said of the findings  there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today he conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20 insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material as for his own company  whose consultants alone have produced more than 1 700 pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs  mr davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to public authorities and investigative teams still  some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources  like the port authority of new york and new jersey  which built and owned the trade center and supports mr silverstein in the suit mr davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his companys ability to release information in a statement  the port authority said access to documents would be decided on a casebycase basis consistent with applicable law and policy  adding that it would cooperate with federal investigations the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell  given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings collapse that investigation  led by the federal emergency management agency  was plagued by few resources  a lack of access to crucial information like building plans  and infighting among experts and officials a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology  or nist  an agency that has studied many building disasters officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings  a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit gerald mckelvey  a spokesman for mr silverstein  said of the real estate executives own heavily financed investigative work  we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr silverstein on the material  but said no transfer had taken place with no shortage of money or expertise  investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory  some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well the work should be available to other investigators  said ramon gilsanz  a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek  who was a member of the earlier inquiry it could be used to build better buildings in the future legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes  from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information in some cases  litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves or they may ask to have them sealed forever it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another  some legitimate  some not  said lee levine  a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan  koch in washington mr levine said that because of the presumed value of the information  the court might look favorably on requests to make it public but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people  especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence  not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests  could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center its important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny  said dr john osteraas  director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park  calif  and a consultant on the case  because then the general engineering community can sort it out the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure mr levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates  hired by silverstein properties  have called upon powerful computer programs  originally developed with the pentagon for classified research  to create a model of the sept 11 attack from beginning to end the result is a compilation of threedimensional images of the severed exterior columns  smashed floor and damaged core of the towers  beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse those images  which mr levy is not allowed to release  have helped pinpoint the structural failures the fema investigators did not have access to such computer modeling nor did the fema team have unfettered access to the trade center site  with all its evidence  in the weeks immediately after the attacks but no such constraints hampered engineers at lzathorntontomasetti  brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept 11 daniel a cuoco  the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case  said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell though the fema team could not determine where things actually fell  mr cuoco said  weve indicated the specific locations mr cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings nor would mr osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers mr osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day  some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence for months  experiments in wind tunnels in the united states and canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures jack cermak  president of cermak peterka peterson in fort collins  colo  was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed windtunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago for the legal case  dr cermak said  weve done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design the data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact  dr cermak said some of the information may be valuable for the litigation  he said  adding  i

345,0, url httpdiveintomarkorgarchives20021008htmlinpraiseofevolvableformats date 20021008t1228100500 clay shirky in praise of evolvable systems1 this entire article could be rewritten to explain rss in fact  lets do that if it were april fools day  the nets only official holiday  and you wanted to design a 8220novelty format8221 to slip by the w3c as a joke  it might look something like rss 09x20  it would specify limits on data values  then remove them  then specify required elements  then make them optional  thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world  it would encourage use of entityencoded html in its most important element  thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user  it would ignore years of standards work in other fields  committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasnt a guid  and using an obsolete date format that couldnt easily be sorted by date  its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them  thus making it wholely resistant to dtd  schema  or validation of any kind  after years of worldwide deployment  it would completely reverse its addwhateveryouwant extensibility rules in favor of namespaces  which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on  after adopting namespaces  it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use it would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways  thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers rss 09x and 20 are the whoopee cushion and joy buzzer of syndication formats for anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata  its pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format  we have the worst one possible except  of course  for all the others the problem with that list of rss deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities8212rss has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has  not despite many of these qualities but because of them the very weaknesses that make rss so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place  removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up rss to a whole new category of producer the weblogger  allowing encoded html in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing rss infrastructure  without requiring them to produce valid xhtml which could be embedded directly into an xml document social mores  rather than technical rules  prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed html elements  few publishing tools can produce real conforming guids  and it doesnt matter  because virtually all rss parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes as for dates  by convention an rss document is laid out in reverse chronological order  and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility furthermore  its almost babyish xml syntax  so far from any serious computational framework where are the namespaces where is the document type description why is the aggregators enforcement of conformity so lax  made it possible for anyone wanting an rss feed to write one the effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to 8220do rss right82218212most notably rss 10 in the year 2000 rss 10 had three main benefits  backward compatible with rss 090  which was never widely deployed  and which fell into obscurity as soon as the much simpler rss 091 was introduced  based on rdf specifically a serialization called rdfxml  a spec which  at the time and to this day  continues to change or threaten to change two years later  there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume rdf  although many perl  python  net have thirdparty rdf parsers in various states of development and conformance the release version is generally out of date cvs access is recommended you get the idea meanwhile  rdfxml production tools are so inconsistent that even rdf experts recommend not using rdf tools to produce an rss 10 feed if you want it to actually be read by any major rss aggregator despite the twoyearold promise of better tools2  it is now the year 2002  and i built my rss 10 feed8212in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world8212by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a textarea of an html form  extensible through namespaces  which  as mentioned above  have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into rss 20  where they appear to be flourishing evolvable formats8212those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways8212have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong  centrally designed formats  only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed my rss feed is an xml document produced by a template that i built in a textarea  and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of xml and hack apart my feed with regular expressions the world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools if everyone in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their disposal  it would be trivial to produce and consume all the worlds metadata in rdf without such perfect tools  both production and consumption instantly become nightmares there is no middle ground  what is  is wrong because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions  they are always behind the times rss was being stretched with long descriptions  optional titles  and entityencoded html even before such practices were codified in the spec  and long before all consumers could handle them no evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces  finally  orgels rule  named for the evolutionary biologist leslie orgel82128220evolution is cleverer than you are8221 as with the list of rsss obvious deficiencies above  it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life no one seeing rss 10 and rss 091 sidebyside could doubt that rss 10 had the superior technology  that it 8220did things right8221 however  the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially rss 20 is not the perfect syndication format  just the best one thats also currently practical infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete  partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition 1 httpwwwshirkycomwritingsevolvehtml 2 httpgroupsyahoocomgroupsyndicationmessage467

350,0, this is not directly spamassassin related  but more of a general dealingwithspam issue what is the best way to deal with spam during the smtp transaction there are domains and addresses that i know are spam at the mail from and can deal with at the smtp level i have been  and i think most people  respond with a 571 code  a permanent error that pretty much means  dont bother to try from that address again  youll get the same error people often add cathartic messages to accompany the 550 like  spammers must die but this might not be the best way to go you are telling the spammers that you are on to them this may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail that is  act like everything is ok during the smtp transaction  but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket this is generally how spamassassin works since almost everyone uses it after the smtp transaction has completed successfully spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods then there is a third possibility instead of returning a 550 code indicating youre on to the spammer  fake a 511 response which is saying mailbox does not exist this would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as nonexistent from their lists i know  a slim hope  but even if only a few do  it can lower the incidence so  what are the arguments for each do spammers even look at any of the bounce messages they get the volume of bounces must be huge personally  im starting to think blackholes are the way to go but sending back that spammer die  die  die  or stock access deenied my ephasis added message can be pretty satisfying   crist j clark                          cjclarkalummitedu      cjclarkjhuedu httppeoplefreebsdorgcjc         cjcfreebsdorg  in remembrance wwwosdncom911  spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet httpslistssourceforgenetlistslistinfospamassassintalk

368,0, brad clements  just curious if subject line capitalization can be used as an indicator   either the percentage of characters that are caps   or  percentage starting with a capital letter if number of words  xx supply a mod to tokenizerpy and ill test it eventually wink  note that the tokenizer already preserves case in subjectline words  because experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this specific context but experiment also showed against my expectations that preserving case everywhere didnt make a significant difference to either error rate  the subject line is a special case for this

440,0, hi everybody im writing a web application in java tomcat  jspservlets  database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is ecommerce  but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database  but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all  how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryptiondecryption the api that im using is the jca jdk14x  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object  and store in the database  but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database  but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password  i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesnt really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list  something i thought that can be of bit interest  but probabily wrong and insecure after all  im a real beginner in secure programming  and im here to learn methods and technics first of all  i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure  so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat  so it is not shared with other web services or  worst  the nobody user  that has no shell login  but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signaturermiwhatever else that the source is the right one  and handle all the database connections  or give the db connectionpassword to the main web application in this way  we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories  and also  an attacker should get rootbean user account to read data this is not perfect  and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means  really  another server running in the background any suggestions thank you  mario torre  please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see httpwwwfsforgphilosophynowordattachmentshtml

475,0, httpwwwcnncom2002worldamericas0826perumotherreutindexhtml lima  peru reuters  lina medinas parents thought their 5yearold daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in perus andes could find no cure  her father carried her to hospital just over a month later  she gave birth to a boy aged 5 years  seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by caesarean section in may 1939  medina made medical history  and is still the youngest known mother in the world at the time  perus government promised aid that never materialized six decades on  medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor  crimeridden district of the peruvian capital known as little chicago now 68  she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past gerardo  the son she delivered while still a child herself  died in 1979 at the age of 40 but a new book  written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case  has drawn fresh attention to medinas story  and raised the prospect that the peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance the government condemned them to live in poverty in any other country  they would be the objects of special care  jose sandoval  author of mother aged 5  told reuters we still have time to repair the damage done to her thats my fundamental objective  he added totally willing to help sandoval has raised medinas case with the office of first lady eliane karp  and has asked the government to grant her a life pension  something officials say is possible were totally willing to help her  said spokeswoman marta castaneda but suni ramos  of the social action department of karps office  said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning  such as kitchen and other household equipment  it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed it is currently trying to contact medina and her family medinas husband  raul jurado  told reuters his wife remained skeptical she got no help in 1939 that i know about  he said she thinks governments never deliver maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true jurado said his wife  whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists  had turned down reuters request for an interview medical rarity no one has ever established who was the father of medinas child  or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo  an andean village at an altitude of 7 400 feet 2 250 meters in perus poorest province  medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history  sandoval said he said she had her first period at 2 12  became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby  they found she already had fully mature sexual organs her swelling stomach worried her parents they thought it was a tumor  he said but shamans ruled out village superstitions  including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them  and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town  pisco there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest  he was later released for lack of evidence  and doctors  police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case sandoval  who based his book on media and other published information  and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment  said news of the child mothertobe drew instant offers of aid  including one worth 5 000 from a us businessman  which was turned down more offers followed after medina was transferred to a lima hospital  where her fully developed 6pound 27 kg baby was born on may 14  1939  mothers day one offer was worth 1 000 a week  plus expenses  for medina and her baby to be exhibited at the worlds fair in new york another  from a us business that the family accepted in early june 1939  was for the pair to travel to the united states for scientists to study the case the offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort but within days  the state trumped all previous offers  decreeing that medina and her baby were in moral danger  and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them but sandoval said it abandoned the case after six months it did absolutely nothing for them happy ending though physically mature  medina  who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms  still behaved like a child  preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby  who was fed by a wet nurse medina stayed in hospital for 11 months  finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again after taunting from schoolmates  gerardo  who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor  discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother he died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the bodys bone marrow  but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young medina married and in 1972 had a second son  33 years after her first her second child now lives in mexico she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject we just want to get on with our lives  thats it  said jurado  adding he thought absolutely nothing of the fact his wife was the worlds youngest mother he said the couples main concern now  if the governments offer of aid was genuine  was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the thengovernment expropriated more than two decades ago that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site he said its value was more or less 25 000 and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own  they live now in a modest house  accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board  in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves paradise if the government really wants to helpthey should give us the value of our property  he said as for sandoval  he said he was optimistic that medinas story  which he has studied since his student days  would turn out well i believe there will be a happy ending  he said as a result of the war  corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the moneypower of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed

502,0, i have some patches that seem to fixavoid this problem now   it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails  long enough for upss to run out  and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply first  i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring  so that if exmh is attempting for any reason to expand a sequence that isnt either a number  or a range of numbers or a list of such things it will simply ignore the trash  rather than giving a traceback this one solves the initial problem  mhtclwasthu aug 22 211506 2002  mhtclwed aug 28 123911 2002  487 6 487 10  set seq  set rseq  foreach range split string trim sequence  if regexp 0909 range       just ignore anything bogus     continue  set parts split string trim range  if llength parts  1  lappend seq parts that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before the code assumes that range is either nnn or nnnmmm so we should probably make sure thats true  issue an error instead of just continue if you like  but i dont think an error is needed but that just allowed me to create a similar problem  in another place  by typing nnn  and rather than continue to fight fires like this  i thought i should think more about brents suggestion   but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input  which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid  i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input  so i just stuck a catch around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed this way  any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal maybe allowing a sequence name  like prev or next  or anything else can be handled just there  without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it but  while i was playing there  i noticed something i never new before if you type 66 the 66 changes to 67 and so on  for each  that is typed   i suspect thats perhaps an artifact of  is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder  but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number  so let it mean  but now i found it  i think its nice    but if we can type 66 why not 66 as well  that kind of limitation bugs me  so i fixed it and then i wondered about folders with names containing   the special use of  as the toggle character means theres no way to type those from the keyboard   so i fixed that as well   this makes two different restrictions  theres no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with  but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway  so i doubt this will bother anyone  and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current  target folder name when the name being typed is empty   im less happy about that part  but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with s in them to exist and be typed then  since i was there anyway  i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me   in normal keyboard mode  s is the key used to show a message    but if youve just typed 123  and the ftoc is highlighting 123 as the current message  and you want to now show that message  you cant type s  you have to type r instead so i fixed this one as well   fixed here is in quotes  as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is s  if you change that to something else  it will remain s in here   i dont know enough tktcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here   r continues to work of course and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code  i also made it clear the status line if you abort messagefolder entry mode c or g previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared  which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings in any case  what follows is the patch that does all of that   i believe that if you apply this  then the one above is probably not needed  the catch around the msgshow will hide the problem i dont think we really need to fix brents way of invoking it   or include it anyway  just for completeness i havent run an exmh with the following patch  but not the previous one  so i dont know for sure that all will be ok then kre  selecttclwasthu aug 22 211507 2002  selecttclwed aug 28 133617 2002  49 9 49 11  bindtags w list w entry bind w anykeyselecttypein w a bind w

536,0, guido  i meant to say that they were 099 clues cancelled out by 001  clues  but thats wrong too  it looks i havent grokked this part of  your code yet this one has way more than 16 clues  and it seems the  classifier basically ended up counting way more 099 than 001 clues   and no others made it into the list  i thought it was looking for  clues with values in between apparently it found none that werent  exactly 05 theres a brief discussion of this before the definition of maxdiscriminators  all clues with prob minspamprob and maxspamprob are saved in min and max lists  and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list  whatever remains of the longer list if anything is then fed into the nbest heap too  but no more than maxdiscriminators of them  in no case do more than maxdiscriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation  but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues else youd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed  in your specific case  the excess of clues in the longer maxspamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap  and thats why you didnt see anything other than 001 and 099 before adding these special lists  the outcome when faced with many 001 and 099 clues was too often a coin toss  whichever flavor just happened to appear maxdiscriminators2  1 times first determined the final outcome  that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues  this happened to be the longest one  but there were quite a few  similar ones i just beat it wink  a tokenization scheme that folds case  and ignores punctuation  and strips a trailing s from words  and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams  turned up a lowprobability very long spam with a list of 410 001 clues and 125 099 clues  yikes  i wonder if theres anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the  html  it was heavily markedup html  with ads in the sidebar  but the body  text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly  technical words as clues including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope  it gets only one 001 clue from doing so ditto for zeo  in contrast  html markup has many unique words that get 099  btw  this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionallyindependent word probabilities is utterly bogus  eg  the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing  by treating them as independent  naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear  and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in tokenizerpy  from the very start  ive been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at pythonorg  and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context  i havent done anything geared toward personal email  including the case of nonmailinglist email that happens to go through pythonorg id prefer to strip html tags from everything  but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block  but as the comment block also says   xxx so  if another way is found to slash the fn rate  the decision here  xxx not to strip html from htmlonly msgs should be revisited and weve since done several things that gave significant fn rate reductions  i should test that again now  are there any minablebutunmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them  apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like contenttype  the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject  from  xmailer  and organization  or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make  progress there i would need different data  yes  my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out  but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i havent changed a byte so far  and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it  in particular i have to skip to and received headers now  and i suspect theyre going to be very valuable in real life for example  i dont even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now    no  sorry  these were all of the following structure     multipartmixed        textplain        brief text plus urls        texthtml         long html copied from website ah  that explains why the html tags didnt get stripped  id again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that theyd get stripped here too  but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink  this seems confused jeremy didnt use my trained classifier pickle   he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora    i think its still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes  and while that did harm the error rates  the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using 500 of each ah  a full test run just finished  on the tokenization scheme that folds case  and ignores punctuation  and strips a trailing s from words  and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code  tokenize everything in the body lastw   for w in wordrefindalltext n  lenw  make sure this range matches in tokenizeword if 3  n  12 if w1  s w  w1 yield w if lastw yield lastw  w lastw  w    elif n  3 lastw   for t in tokenizewordw yield t where wordre  recompilerwx80xff this at least doubled the process size over whats done now  it helped the fn rate significantly  but probably hurt the fp rate the fp rate is too low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small

540,0, this is for those that have interacted with d winer daves idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around  youre supposed to just shut up and take it httpwinerloginspiredsitesnet  whos the real monster it seems good ol uncle dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him  it seems ben  kevin and bill are making too strong a case  so here we daves attempt to fool you into thinking theyre some sort of monsters  violent ones no less anyone who works with hemenway or kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters  who will stoop to any level to get their way yeah sure dave  whatever you need to believe the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general  each with their own brand of attitude  to be sure  but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward  how is that being monstrous is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the publics perception of them  if you havent already  contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness 91802 100738 am  discuss dave deflects what he cant take the time to understand its really quite pitiful  when normal people dont understand something they usually try learning about it  they read up  ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it  this before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools what dave does is just the opposite posts a link to something he doesnt understand gets a bunch of email from people who do understand it derides the idea as being too much trouble and blogs it expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates  incorrectly  about only part of the issue realizes hes been a fool but refuses to correct himself plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy tries making the educated people look like fools sends private emails to them trying to scare them off exposes any private email they write  out of context deflects and runs off to some new topic  repeats from 1 his continued diatribes about rss10 and its use of rdf reveal this to be true  dave doesnt get the idea of the semantic web  hed rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying one reader wrote to us with a good analogy  its like that movie the poseidon adventure  daves like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow  i dont know about you but id rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room the ships fucking sinking and i dont want to be following the idiot daves idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around  youre supposed to just shut up and take it  after all  why would good ol uncle dave want to hurt you  its all about love  right  to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted  and if you dare complain  he savages you  then he tries to make everyone think youre the one causing all the trouble weve news for you dave  were wise to your tactics and were talking amongst ourselves about it  were routing around you damaging behavoir thats where were coming from if you have an example of how youve tried to help dave  please drop us an email about it  well keep it strictly confidential of course  send it along to zaphodegroupscom 91202 101311 am  discuss trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig the trouble is  you get dirty and the pig seems to like it another developer tries talking to dave and discovers its fundamentally impossible his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web developers are doing a terrible job in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering that guy is an idiot the zaphodim  however  are veteran pig wrestlers  if youve got a similar tale from the mud pit  be sure to drop us a line at zaphodegroupscom 91102 21758 pm  discuss 1 response aha some backing down by the whining one it would appear the dictator release strategy that daves been trying on his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support im going to push back the caveatremoving on the 20 spec by 24 hours still have work to do on the sample file  i want to look into the rfc for timedate specs  and get started on the radio implementation of 20 i have to prepare for seybold tomorrow  and i want to a little memorial for 911 a busy few days for a guy still recovering also  it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 20 spec and see if there are any dealstoppers hell yeah there are deal stoppers  like nobody wants it nor will they use it the poor radio customers  the poor salon blog users  theyre going to be dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use  so with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card  what utter fucking nonsense  this past weekend  the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame america bullshit  then the rss community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of rss  now hes trying to pretend we should be nice to him because hes still recovering uh  dave  if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights  well still kick your ass regardless  thats what years of your abusing people has gotten you dave  no sympathy anymore  none whatsoever 91102 15610 pm  discuss dave is scary on 911 posted on scripting news on 9102002 note during the day tomorrow there will be no updates to scripting news ill be in sf at seybold  leading a discussion on web services for publishing with people from amazon  apple  google and jake savin of userland i may be able to update my radio weblog  but only if theres something really important to report so best wishes for a happy and safe 911 what kind of asshole wishes people a happy 911 obviously someone who doesnt have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy 91102 75606 am  discuss yeow and we though we were harsh wow  apparently daves sticking his neck out quite far these days  craig schamp practically keelhauls him with this one  he wraps it up with the man seems to show over and over that hes nothing more than a whining buffoon give that man an honorary zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring related links over at photodude  richard bennett  andrea harris  reid stott  jeff jarvis  ipse dixit  and the fat guy 9902 122945 pm  discuss rss 20 code name hitler if dave tries to steamroll rss 20 through without formal community consensus  here now we call it the hitler release of 20 no objections  no  he means no objections i choose to hear dave is simply not listening  people are objecting all over 9602 90002 am  discuss referral log funnies every now and then we check the referral logs to see whats pointing back to us  we sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search 9502 121507 pm  discuss luserland attempts to trademark rss dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt scripting news is full of examples so we found it surprising  as did many others  when luserland software tried to patent the term rss back in 2000 heres the patent application httptarrusptogovservlettarrregserserialentry78025336 this was apparently just between the start of the rss 10 development efforts  and the publication of the specification winer knew about the rss 10 stuff  indeed  he complained about it bitterly at the time could dave be any more transparent since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do a good quote from before he filed the patent application tim oreilly says patents are ok  hes just against stupid patents in the spirit of touch of grey  tim man  patents are lockin of the worst kind theres no way to route around them 9402 60651 am  discuss whens a permalink not a permalink when dave writes an item  then removes it the permalink links to nothing at that point so apparently the perma part in permalink is permanent for everyone except dave too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this 9202 61603 pm  discuss

575,0, on mon  20020923 at 1353  jim whitehead wrote   you have not explained why the increase in co2 concentrations is not  contributing to increasing global temperature there are a number of reasons to think that co2 is not important to controlling global temperature and that much of the co2 increase may not be anthropogenic some recent research points worth mentioning recent highresolution studies of historical co2 concentrations and temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest correlation between the two in a number of cases  co2 level increases are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the increase in temperature by a short time ie increases in temperature preceded increases in co2 concentrations the more studies that are done of the geological record  the more it seems that co2 concentrations are correlated with temperature increases  but are not significantly causative there is a lot of evidence that co2 levels are regulated in a fairly stable fashion  i dont believe anyone really has an authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet with respect to absolute co2 concentrations  it is also important to point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly regular cycle with a period of about 100 000 years  at previous cycle peaks  the concentrations were similar to what they are now  if this cycle has any validity and we only have good data for 45 complete cyclical periods  but which look surprisingly regular in shape and time  then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now  as it happens  current co2 concentrations are within 10 of other previous cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data in other words  we may be adding to the co2 levels  but it looks a lot like we would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical record  at the very least  there is nothing anomalous about current co2 concentrations also  co2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately affects temperature  again  the interaction is not entirely predictable  but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative feedback systems mentioned above last  as greenhouse gases go  co2 isnt particularly potent  although it makes up for it in volume in some cases  gases such as water and methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule basis  water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas  something that co2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the biosphere co2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism  but all the recent studies and data ive seen gives me the impression that it is largely a passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver  i certainly dont think it is a healthy fixation if were actually interested in understanding warming trends cheers  james rogers jamesrbestcom

578,0, kevin oberman said  it did for me  but i am not willing to say it is not a tcltk issue as  other apps seemed to work ok for cut and paste and tk does its  clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits so im not  about to place blame just reporting my experience one more salvo on x and cutpaste  x specifies at least two mechanisms for cutpaste  but as usual mandates no policy  windows and macintosh have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy  im quite sure that tk implements all primary and clipboard selections accurately the primary selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection on your x display  the clipboard selection is the one with the explicit copy step  and is the same as what you have on windows and macintosh however  exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism  which is another archaic mechanism supported at one point perhaps still today by versions of emacs  exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these mechanisms under one umbrella  and by all reports it is not that great i would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in textselection and report what works well for them  we may come up with 8 lines that work for everyone  or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models  of course  thats an admission of policy failure  but im willing to do that  brent welch software architect  panasas inc pioneering the worlds most scalable and agile storage network wwwpanasascom welchpanasascom  exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhusers

586,0, on sat  24 aug 2002 110700 0700  john hall johnhallevergonet said  ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the  ten commandments  it seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit   too by meanings have evolved do you or they mean that the hebrew words have changed meaning or that our understanding of the hebrew words have changed or do they posit a premosaic form of the laws that had evolved by time of the pentateuch  in particular  there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was  actually specifically about man stealing  selling a free man into  slavery this seems bogus to me a quick check of the text indicates the the hebrew word in question is ganav which elsewhere in the pentateuch eg gen 448 is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things in july 1999  i made the following comment in response to a similar claim about the real meaning of one of the ten commandments   the translations since cause problems at each successive remove we have the original language versions  though  so this is not an issue  im sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment  is thou shalt not murder rather than kill  this has nothing to do with successive translations it is based on our knowledge of the meaning of the hebrew word ratsach most modern translations ive seen translate it murder but elsewhere the word is used of an animal killing a human something for which most english speakers wouldnt use the word murder   httpwwwxentcomforkarchivejuly990163html james  james tauber jtauberjtaubercom httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork

ones with no text between them  and looked at the longest run of consecutive imgs within a message this one seems to do pretty good  because in my nonspam corpus theres only a handful of messages with

deregulation sender dbsphilodoxcom httpwwwsiliconvalleycommldsiliconvalley4144696htmtemplatecontentmodulesprintstoryjsp posted on tue  sep 24  2002 dan gillmor state needs intelligent energy deregulation by dan gillmor mercury news technology columnist the facts were trade and government secrets at the time but the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and naturalgas prices in california now  as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess well be cleaning up for decades  were learning what everyone suspected market games helped engineer the price spikes the latest manipulation was highlighted in mondays finding by a federal administrative law judge  who said a dominant naturalgas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers his ruling came a few days after californias public utilities commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch  also driving up prices and dont forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system  in schemes best summed up by an enron insiders boast in a memorandum made public in may  that enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion how much of this was illegal  as opposed to simply amoral  remains to be seen unfortunately  californias response  confusion  lawsuits and policy tweaks  hasnt been sufficient more unfortunately  even if the state suddenly did all the right things  including a hardnosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers grips  we would need a willing federal partner but its foolish to think that the bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states  or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional  nonrenewable energy sources if the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit  the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001 thats a reasonable approach  but dont expect miracles state policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation  meanwhile instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation  still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices  state laws and regulations put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers  notes v john white  executive director of the sacramentobased center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies wwwceertorg its tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities  tempting but a bad idea when theres genuine competition  as we could achieve in electricity generation  the private sector tends to do a better job instead of abandoning deregulation  california should find a way to inject real competition into the market we do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization  at least under current conditions smart regulation is essential but the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control there are two ways conservation and replacement we need more of both the best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables by 2017  californias utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources several power companies are expected to do this even sooner but this law has an element of oldline thinking  the captivecustomer model we need to be getting away from  not sustaining lip service to newer ideas isnt enough the state should be removing barriers to microgeneration systems  small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized  hardertodisrupt electricity to homes and businesses this technology is coming along fast state policies are not keeping pace investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all california should be doing more to encourage this  whether through tax incentives or outright grants in lowincome households california hasnt done badly on conservation in a general sense  and energy customers did react to last years soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back  but its lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether maybe this is all pointless the bush administrations energy policies  so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil  coal and nuclear  are making us all more vulnerable never mind what might happen if the coming war in iraq goes badly its pointless to hope for a sane federal policy  a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogenbased energy system but the largest state  one of the worlds major economies in its own right  does have some clout we can hit the ripoff artists where it hurts  and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions maybe next year   r a hettinga mailto rahibuccom the internet bearer underwriting corporation httpwwwibuccom 44 farquhar street  boston  ma 02131 usa  however it may deserve respect for

proxy that denies access to any url with a tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site  and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which  to be honest  is probably accurate  given the nature of her work but never mind that i dont want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the tilde every commandlineloving geek will tell you that  stands for 8220home directory8221  and cd  will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone elses  except on mac os x  where it will take you to their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can trace the presentday practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages  since one single systemwide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or  more commonly now that apache has taken over the world  in their publichtml subdirectory  except on mac os x  where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to httplocalhostusername  youre actually being served files from that users sites directory within their home directory but i dont want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde as with so many other things  i find that jukka korpela1 is the expert in this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass2  a word which google  old habits die hard3 feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford  which  like jukkas home page  can not be referenced without a tilde in fact  jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls4  a treatise which  i feel obliged to point out  contains a tilde in its url clearly  the tilde is underappreciated digging further  we find this post of jukkas from 19985  in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all  but rather an odd character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline  if indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe  to be sure  but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter the tilde was the tilde so that spanishtyping types could type the ntilde now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde  but somewhere along the line  it morphed into a generalpurpose character with all sorts of geeky uses digging even further  it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 6  then an alternate for   and its life as an overline replacement came even later jukka confirms this7 and adds a timeline 1963 for   1964 for   1966 for overline then june 30  1966  the watershed moment in an x3 committee meeting  when it was proposed 8220as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease share8221 i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means  or what this committee meeting was about the next reference isnt until 1991  when the tilde was officially added to iso6468 and now  down the rabbit hole we go scouring usenet which the kids of yesterday called 8220deja news8221  and kids today call 8220google groups8221  we find a reprint of a 1991 william safire yes  that william safire article on language9  in which we learn that  is officially pronounced 8220squiggle8221 this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary 10 to this very day im not sure this is useful  but i just thought it was cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ascii characters as early as august 1990  tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem 11 in july 1989  kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde12 in february 1988  an editors note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde13 as early as january 1987  less used the tilde to denote lines past eof14 as early as july 1986  troff supported the tilde15 in november 1985  a modsources post refers to bourne shell enhancements history tilde job control16 as early as january 1984  tilde was included on the dec keyboard17 and listed in the apl11 character set18 in april 1983  tilde was causing bugs in vi19 actually due to underlying bugs in csh in december 1982   is officially pronounced 8220tilde822120  prompting this typographical pun21 and thats the earliest reference i can find so where does that leave us unsatisfied  no doubt there is history here  but there are gaps what happened at that watershed meeting in 1966 how did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s when did it become a synonym for 8220home directory8221 when did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites i dont know  and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research  a failing for which i apologize profusely goodnight  goodnight may you dream of tildes  stars  and whorls 1  httpwwwcstutfijkorpela 2

692,0, snip misc rants about finding jobs  java vs c  what makes a good programmer  etc snip okay  hmm  i thought twice about this  but what the hey  jobs are hard to come by theres a company hiring in mountain view  looking for a few good hackers  no java  no gui  not even c  just c and linux and networking and good old stuff like that they just raised a wad of money and theyre looking for a few really good programmers  says the cto i know him  very smart guy drives too fast  though  for what thats worth joe bob says check it out id be happy to pass on your resume  or you can send it straight to them probably wont matter if i pass it on  since i dont know you guys anyway httpwwwnetlicom  sherry  original message  from joseph s barrera iii mailtojoebarreraorg  sent tuesday  august 27  2002 858 am  to adam l beberg  cc forkexamplecom  subject re java is for kiddies    adam l beberg wrote    forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job       i was talking about the open reqs at kana the company i  work for     oh  but programming in java is beneath you       nope just lacking years and years of it for some silly  reason people    always want things to be reliable  fast  and  crossplatform so all my    employers have forced me to code in c    c is more reliable than java   as for crossplatform  c exists on more platforms  but a java program  is much easier to move from one platform to another so im not sure  what you mean   im not trying to fight a language war  but im puzzled by the depth  of your antijava hatred     i know lots of high school    kiddies with plenty of java tho  not having to teach people about    pointers or optimization or anything shaves years off the  coder boot    time ill send them your way when they graduate   pointers so a language has to have pointers to be real and  references  dont count  i gather whats so great about pointers why do you  miss them if your doing embedded stuff  fine  yes  you need the  performance and control over memory that c provides probably  but if your implementing tier n1 of a tier n system  and pounding  against a database  then java is often a very reasonable choice  especially if you want that system to run without leaking memory   optimization who says you cant optimize java i can and have   and there are good tools that allow you to do it i use optimizeit  but usually i find myself optimizing reducing database accesses  instead i sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by  grouping more operations into fewer transactions   but this is beside the point if you have decent c experience  and  have poked around in java  you should be able to convince most  employers that you can be trusted writing java thats what i did   i mean  i joined kana from microsoft  and i didnt exactly write  a lot of java code at microsoft     im not displeased youre trying to help  just frustrated that    employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills with    insane years of experience   i dont think ive ever interviewed at a place where i actually  met all the prerequisites do you just give up when you dont     interview tommorow with kodak  doing i have no idea what as the    recruiter isnt even sure  but cross your fingers it wont require 10    years of java and 5 years of windowsia64s device driver  experience    both common requirements   i wish you best of luck  and i apologies for being a bitch  but god damn  you piss me off sometimes my son occasionally  displays your cantdo attitude and i do my damnest to  get him to reverse course    joe

694,0,  the historical record  by which you mean human historical record  is  highly overrated nigh worthless when you are talking about geological  timescales  even on topics with as short a timescale as climate there has been a significant recent increase in global co2 concentrations the vast preponderance of the new co2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of europe  and accelerating after wwii most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased co2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming hence our interest in items of human time scale  it is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited  during the last major ice age  they are finding substantial evidence of  humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers  paved over their civilization  the receding glaciers have turned into a  bit of an archaeological treasure chest  as they expose artifacts buried  in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the  ice for thousands of years  i dont see any compelling reason to save  the glaciers anyway  particularly in light of the fact that their  existence has always been transient most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today the point of global warming isnt to save the earth  the planet is not sentient the point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity  for anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are  anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another  ill  just stick with occams razor for now the increase in atmospheric co2 concentration is due to human activity it is generally accepted that increases in co2 in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy this is the current best explanation for the high temperature of venus if the co2 concentration goes up globally which it has  then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy this process may be slow  and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide i encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking co2 to eventual increases in global energy content  part of which will be evident as heat  jim 
696,0, depends on how much over spending vs how much and what type over regulation the biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible it also has the ability to single out particular people  while over spending spreads the damage more evenly  rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing as for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both  i find no fault in that definition whatsoever  the opinion that either we are spending too much or we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics finally  those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature no private replacements  no government regulation is better than government regulation itself and in my experience people who label themselves green which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly is a watermelon  original message  from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of geege  schuman   funny i read it as green  red  as in accounting  as in fiscally  irresponsible  which do you think is the worse indictment   overregulation  or overspending  there are many dickheads who buy into the  neoconservative medias foxs definiton of liberal as one who seeks  to  impose both

701,0,  if the text recognition algorithmarchitecture humans use is anything  like the algorithmstructure weve been working with  the reason the  first letter and to a lesser extent  the last letter is important is  that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially  more difficult from a theoretical standpoint anyway and has to be  resolved using deeper abstraction analysis  the middle letters are far  less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly i think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct spelling is important  would be interesting to see if this same effect is applicable to written forms of other languages  maybe even japanese romongi bill

710,0, xvid 1 is a project to make gpl divx codecs sigma designs 1 is a company  looking to put out hardware to playback  amongst other things  divx files problem is sigma is using xvids gpled code in ways not very gpl the  resultsxvid stops work on thier code and ask the users to put preasure  on sigma to honor the gpl some notes from other places from doom9 3 xvid development has been stopped the sigma designs realmagic mpeg4 video codec contains wide portions of code taken from the xvid project soon after the initial release of the realmagic codec the xvid developers have contacted sigma and informed them about the gpl violation for those who dont know  xvid is distributed under the gnu public license  gpl  which demands that if you modify a gpl program you have to release it under the gpl  which in this case means that the source code of the sigma codec must be freely available sigma promised to replace the stolen code  but the new version of the codec which was released this month only disguises the stolen code  it was not actually removed sigma was once again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today nothing has happened therefore the xvid team is now turning to the public in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince sigma designs to respect the terms of the gpl and until the matter has been resolved xvid development will not continue that being said i hope all the forum members who saw their threads about the sigma codecs being closed will understand our motivation now internally we already knew what was going on but since the xvid authors first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes and kept quiet about the matter at hand update sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of the source code of their mpeg4 codec and its already up for download however  not a word was lost about the xvid issue and the press release makes one think that the sigma codec was entirely developed by sigma so we might be hearing more about this update i found a gpl notice in some of the source code files  but it also looks like sigma placed their own copyright lines there and xvid doesnt get any credit in the source either the gpl notice also collides with sigmas software licensing agreement that you have to sign before downloading codec or source on on the same issue divxnetworks said theyd fully support xvid in this issue and apparently dxns relationship with sigma didnt really work out either  as sigmas xcard is not as divx compatible as it was advertised updatefirst an update on the xvid situation the release of the sigma source code does not mean its all over  its far from being over the license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download  and install the codec is not compatible with the gpl furthermore  it can now clearly be seen download the source code and have a look for yourself that the sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the xvid codec  but all the copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and replaced this does not only violate the gpl but copyright laws  you cant just take a program  change a few lines and change the copyright statements  you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on your own and related to this the sigma codec also contains code taken from the opendivx project  the files were outfitted with 2 different copyright notices which is quite funny 1 httpwwwxvidorg 2 httpwwwsigmadesignscom 3 httpwwwdoom9org httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork

724,0, well  for one  it would free up the similar laptop i already got to just run amithlon or if that wasnt so fun  bsd to run just openbsd this is a nearterm thing i could look forward to however  an official laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned  most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a dell 2650  preferably 1 geforce4 440 go or newer  pleasingly modern gpu the geforce2go with 16mb video ram too little i have is not so much too slow as inefficient with factory settings it would actually crash from running too hot and too fast accelerating the ami and possibly openuae graphics is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments  but an energyefficient gpu is a good sideeffect and portability read battery lifetime enabler 15 great control over cpu state by use of internet keys wired to biosbhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll wheel  also  hibernate that works  please 17 bootable to usb 20 drives eg larger external ones in bios  please 2 p4 dells overheat  they have a big heatsink and a little fan to pull air through it  and if you dont elevate thelaptop off the desk or table or bed its on  the fan will stay on  not good for mtbs mean time between service unless youve got an angle on making money on service from amigans one excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs behind the amlcd  thus using the backside of the display half as a radiator though it interferes with the case notion below  yes  aavid or such makes some as a standard part i prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative mass in elevating the laptop ie in the form of a catchhandle and second logo device behind the laptop  which generally provides stow and attachment for elevation legs move them out farther to get to the nexthigher ekevation  until the sides of the laptop are met  this also happens to provide a little protection for usb 2  and 1394 cables that i tend to keep plugged in all the time a bit longer port life please 3 a case color other than brown or black  and preferably if the display module nre is entirely permissive the capability to run with the backlight off  again  to save battery power  but also as a feature maybe you remember the ibooks modified in this manner  the user has the privilege to pull out the backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipecf assembly  with

excellent color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably the logo should be a coloration of a minimal surface  as the maa is trying to get me to renew with  demos at

746,0, url httpwwwjoelonsoftwarecomnews20021008html date not supplied feedback from my posting1 about fogbugz2 setup fell into four categories why make setup reversable instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end there are a couple of things to understand here first of all  even if you do everything in one batch at the end  theres always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail  and in that case  a wellbehaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done there are well over 100 error messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant second  its not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake for example  early in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use img httpwwwjoelonsoftwarecompicturessetupnewacctgif fogbugz setup screenshot the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons  none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account for example  the password might not conform to the system password policy and different national versions of windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords betcha didnt know that its better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later  forcing the user to back up and fix it and even if you force the user to back up and fix it  you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account  otherwise youve left their system in an indeterminate state in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a useful error message and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable well  in order to upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot and we never  ever require a reboot  we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping fogbugz files pinned down  such as iis microsofts web server so part one of the batch is stop iis now if part 2 fails for some reason  it would be extremely rude to leave iis not running and anyway  its not like i dont need to write the code for start iis for the end of the batch so the code to rollback stop iis is already written no big deal  i just need to call it at the right place i think one reason that people think you should gather all the info and then do all the work is because with very large installation programs that are very slow  this is a polite way to waste less of the users time indeed even fogbugz setup does 95 of its work at the very end but the create account operation is so fast  that principle simply doesnt apply here even our 95 of the work phase takes well under a minute  most of which is spent waiting for iis to stop and start why did you use vcmfc surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that delphi3 is more productive first of all  leave your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door somehow i managed to figure out in high school that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring secondly  even if delphi were more productive  the only pertinent question  since i am writing the code  is what is more productive for joel spolsky and i dont know delphi at all  but i know win32  mfc  and vc really  really well so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer  i would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer which is me  certainly over a short 4 week project third  many of the things i needed to do in this setup program are things like grant the logon as service privilege to an account this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general when you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt  what you find is about 75 c code  maybe 20 vb code  and 5 everything else yes  i know  i could translate the c code into delphi assuming i was a sophisticated delphi programmer  not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer  but that costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language and fourth  i already had about 30 of the code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz 20 setup  and a library ive been using for years to make wizards why make setup at all you already have your customers money good setup programs dont increase sales this was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest i came up with three reasons  decreased tech support cost this setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code  delight my customers when im trying to get them to upgrade to 40  i want them to remember how painless the 30 installation was  so they wont hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade im still using an old version of spamassassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective  even though i know the new version is much better  because i just cant bear the thought of another morning wasted the very memory of the first spamassassin installation  all the little ssh windows  some sued  trying to scroll through man pages and google groups  accidentally hitting ctrlz in emacs to undo and having it suspend  trying to guess why we cant get the mta to run procmail  sorry its too much if spamassassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they dont have a setup program  win reviews software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software  even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers they always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to pc games  mainframe databases  web site auction software  and dna sequencing software and setup is always on their list a single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it and say aha how can we make wise4 better kudos to the product manager of wise installation system for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the

750,0, free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty im not a sociopoliticalhistory buff  does anybody have some clear examples  original message  from rohit khare kharealumnicaltechedu to forkexamplecom sent friday  september 20  2002 510 pm subject sed sunited statesroman empireg   a world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human   race lives on less than 2 a day  is neither just nor stable   absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about  life on earth today   the following is a fascinating document of official government policy  that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in  an imperfect world     the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does    however  reveal the clash inside a civilization  a battle for the   future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an   area where america must excel   i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa   our new musicandnews channel for 1530 year old arabs its 1 in  practically every market its entered  nearing 90 listenership in  amman and its even beginning to be trusted for news  well past bbc and  taking share from every other government broadcaster   it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the longterm  as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term   many of you may disagree  but i found the document below surprisingly  centrist if you know the code  you can hear clearly partisan tones  re  icc  taiwan relations act  etc but  still  this is as much a democratic  platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared  they might   as you read  replace united states with roman empire and it may make  as much sense  in the long view of history i dont know how proud to be  about that  but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president  might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to  our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700 military installations  overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on  how engaged we are in the world around us   heck  id love to see a realtime map of federal expenditures around the  globe  a softly glowing necklace of embassies  carriers  arctic research  stations  hotels  golf courses  warehouses  libraries  clinics and all  the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy   of course  this still doesnt leave me any more comfortable with the  real news in this document the bush doctrine for preemptive strikes  id sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit  such a principle to be loosed upon the world   rohit     september 20  2002   full text bushs national security strategy   following is the full text of president bushs new national security  strategy the document  entitled the national security strategy of the  united states  will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of  the administrations policy   introduction   the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and  totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of  freedom  and a single sustainable model for national success freedom   democracy  and free enterprise in the twentyfirst century  only  nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and  guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the  potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people  everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them  worship as they please educate their children  male and female own  property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom  are right and true for every person  in every society  and the duty of  protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of  freedomloving people across the globe and across the ages   today  the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military  strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our  heritage and principles  we do not use our strength to press for  unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that  favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies  can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and  economic liberty by making the world safer  we allow the people of the  world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace  against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace  by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the  peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent   defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental  commitment of the federal government today  that task has changed  dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great  industrial capabilities to endanger america now  shadowy networks of  individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less  than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to  penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies  against us   to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal   from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and  cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global  reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help  nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will  hold to account nations that are compromised by terror  because the  allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and  countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop  new home bases together  we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every  turn   the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism  and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking  weapons of mass destruction  and evidence indicates that they are doing  so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to  succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other  means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny   contain  and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous  technologies and  as a matter of common sense and selfdefense  america  will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we  cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must  be prepared to defeat our enemies plans  using the best intelligence  and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who  saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have  entered  the only path to safety is the path of action   as we defend the peace  we will also take advantage of an historic  opportunity to preserve the peace today  the international community  has the best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the  seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace  instead of continually prepare for war today  the worlds great powers  find ourselves on the same side  united by common dangers of terrorist  violence and chaos the united states will build on these common  interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by  common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition  reaching  for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese  leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of  national wealth in time  they will find that social and political  freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage  the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations   because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and  international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great  powers  even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity   trade  and cultural advancement   finally  the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend  the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring  the hope of democracy  development  free markets  and free trade to  every corner of the world the events of september 11  2001  taught us  that weak states  like afghanistan  can pose as great a danger to our  national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people  into terrorists and murderers yet poverty  weak institutions  and  corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and  drug cartels within their borders   the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a  better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free  trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies  out of poverty  so the united states will work with individual  nations  entire regions  and the entire global trading community to  build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity  the united states will deliver greater development assistance through  the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly   invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom we will also  continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of  aids and other infectious diseases   in building a balance of power that favors freedom  the united states is  guided by the conviction that all nations have important  responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror  nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the  spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international  aid must govern themselves wisely  so that aid is well spent for  freedom to thrive  accountability must be expected and required   we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer   better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply  the strength of freedomloving nations the united states is committed  to lasting institutions like the united nations  the world trade  organization  the organization of american states  and nato as well as  other longstanding alliances coalitions of the willing can augment  these permanent institutions in all cases  international obligations  are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to  rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment   freedom is the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of  every person  in every civilization throughout history  freedom has  been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the  clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and  it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today  humanity  holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedoms triumph over all  these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in  this great mission   i overview of americas international strategy    our nations cause has always been larger than our nations defense we  fight  as we always fight  for a just peace  a peace that favors  liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists  and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among  the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and  open societies on every continent        president bush  west point  new york  june 1  2002     the united states possesses unprecedented  and unequaled  strength  and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of  liberty  and the value of a free society  this position comes with  unparalleled responsibilities  obligations  and opportunity the great  strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that  favors freedom   for most of the twentieth century  the world was divided by a great  struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and  equality   that great struggle is over the militant visions of class  nation  and  race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and  discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we  are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by  catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must  defeat these threats to our nation  allies  and friends   this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to  translate this moment of influence into decades of peace  prosperity   and liberty the us national security strategy will be based on a  distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our  values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help  make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to  progress are clear political and economic freedom  peaceful relations  with other states  and respect for human dignity   and this path is not americas alone it is open to all   to achieve these goals  the united states will    champion aspirations for human dignity    strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends    work with others to defuse regional conflicts    prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our  friends  with weapons of mass destruction    ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade    expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy    develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of  global power and    transform americas national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century    ii champion aspirations for human dignity    some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the  language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require  different methods  but not different moralities       president bush  west point  new york  june 1  2002     in pursuit of our goals  our first imperative is to clarify what we  stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because  these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation  owns these aspirations  and no nation is exempt from them fathers and  mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live  free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be  oppressed  aspire to servitude  or eagerly await the midnight knock of  the secret police   america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human  dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state  free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women  religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property   these demands can be met in many ways americas constitution has served  us well many other nations  with different histories and cultures   facing different circumstances  have successfully incorporated these  core principles into their own systems of governance history has not  been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and  aspirations of their people   our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in  our worst moments  the principles enshrined in the declaration of  independence were there to guide us as a result  america is not just a  stronger  but is a freer and more just society   today  these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and  when openings arrive  we can encourage change  as we did in central  and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991  or in belgrade in 2000 when  we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in  the republic of korea  and see elected leaders replace generals in latin  america and africa  we see examples of how authoritarian systems can  evolve  marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all  cherish   embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today   the national security strategy of the united states must start from  these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty   our principles will guide our governments decisions about international  cooperation  the character of our foreign assistance  and the allocation  of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international  bodies   we will    speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of  human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to  advance freedom    use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who  struggle nonviolently for it  ensuring that nations moving toward  democracy are rewarded for the steps they take    make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key  themes in our bilateral relations  seeking solidarity and cooperation  from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights  to move toward a better future and    take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience  and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments    we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist  it   iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends    just three days removed from these events  americans do not yet have  the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already  clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been  waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is  peaceful  but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on  the timing and terms of others it will end in a way  and at an hour  of  our choosing       president bush  washington  dc the national cathedral  september 14  2001     the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of  global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or  religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism  premeditated   politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents   in many regions  legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a  lasting peace such grievances deserve to be  and must be  addressed  within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united  states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals  with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who  knowingly harbor or provide aid to them   the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in  our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly  elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come  through the persistent accumulation of successes  some seen  some  unseen   today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can   and will  do against regimes that harbor  support  and use terrorism to  achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition  forces continue to hunt down the taliban and alqaida but it is not  only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of  trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america  south  america  europe  africa  the middle east  and across asia   our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist  organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command   control  and communications material support and finances this will  have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate   we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a  coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional  campaign localizes the threat to a particular state  we will help ensure  the state has the military  law enforcement  political  and financial  tools necessary to finish the task   the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the  financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of  funding for terrorism  freeze the assets of terrorists and those who  support them  deny terrorists access to the international financial  system  protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists   and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative  financial networks   however  this campaign need not be sequential to be effective  the  cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we  seek   we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by    direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and  international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist  organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of  terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction  wmd or their precursors    defending the united states  the american people  and our interests  at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it  reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to  enlist the support of the international community  we will not hesitate  to act alone  if necessary  to exercise our right of selfdefense by  acting preemptively against such terrorists  to prevent them from doing  harm against our people and our country and    denying further sponsorship  support  and sanctuary to terrorists  by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign  responsibilities    we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international  terrorism this includes    using the full influence of the united states  and working closely  with allies and friends  to make clear that all acts of terrorism are  illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as  slavery  piracy  or genocide behavior that no respectable government  can condone or support and all must oppose    supporting moderate and modern government  especially in the muslim  world  to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote  terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation    diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by  enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources  on areas most at risk and    using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of  information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of  those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism    while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also  strengthening americas homeland security to protect against and deter  attack   this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization  since the truman administration created the national security council  and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland  security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental  reordering of the fbi  our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland  encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public  and the private sector   this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example   emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with  terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened  to manage not just bioterror  but all infectious diseases and  masscasualty dangers our border controls will not just stop  terrorists  but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic   while our focus is protecting america  we know that to defeat terrorism  in todays globalized world we need support from our allies and friends  wherever possible  the united states will rely on regional organizations  and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where  governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities  we  will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and  our allies can provide   as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan  we will continue to work  with international organizations such as the united nations  as well as  nongovernmental organizations  and other countries to provide the  humanitarian  political  economic  and security assistance necessary to  rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people   threaten its neighbors  and provide a haven for terrorists   in the war against global terrorism  we will never forget that we are  ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom  and fear are at war  and there will be no quick or easy end to this  conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism  we are forging new   productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in  ways that meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century   iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts    we build a world of justice  or we will live in a world of coercion  the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements  look so small       president bush  berlin  germany  may 23  2002     concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional  disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in  an increasingly interconnected world  regional crisis can strain our  alliances  rekindle rivalries among the major powers  and create  horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states  falter  the united states will work with friends and partners to  alleviate suffering and restore stability   no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which us action   direct or indirect  is warranted we have finite political  economic   and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states  will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind    the united states should invest time and resources into building  international relationships and institutions that can help manage local  crises when they emerge    the united states should be realistic about its ability to help  those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when  people are ready to do their part  we will be willing to move decisively    policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will  apply these principles   the israelipalestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of  human suffering  because of americas close relationship with the state  of israel and key arab states  and because of that regions importance  to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace  for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed  to an independent and democratic palestine  living beside israel in  peace and security like all other people  palestinians deserve a  government that serves their interests  and listens to their voices  and  counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all  parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and  comprehensive settlement to the conflict   the united states  the international donor community  and the world bank  stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic  development  increased humanitarian assistance and a program to  establish  finance  and monitor a truly independent judiciary if  palestinians embrace democracy  and the rule of law  confront  corruption  and firmly reject terror  they can count on american support  for the creation of a palestinian state   israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine  permanent occupation threatens israels identity and democracy so the  united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete  steps to support the emergence of a viable  credible palestinian state  as there is progress towards security  israel forces need to withdraw  fully to positions they held prior to september 28  2000 and consistent  with the recommendations of the mitchell committee  israeli settlement  activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides   freedom of movement should be restored  permitting innocent palestinians  to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial  role but  ultimately  lasting peace can only come when israelis and  palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them   in south asia  the united states has also emphasized the need for india  and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested  time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and  pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a  constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with  pakistan  our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistans  choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more  open and tolerant society the administration sees indias potential to  become one of the great democratic powers of the twentyfirst century  and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our  involvement in this regional dispute  building on earlier investments in  bilateral relations  looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan  that can help defuse military confrontation   indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and  respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities  respecting  the rule of law  and accepting open markets  indonesia may be able to  employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its  neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by  indonesia that allows us assistance to make a difference   in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with  countries that share our priorities  particularly mexico  brazil   canada  chile  and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic  hemisphere where our integration advances security  prosperity   opportunity  and hope we will work with regional institutions  such as  the summit of the americas process  the organization of american states  oas  and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of  the entire hemisphere   parts of latin america confront regional conflict  especially arising  from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict  and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and  security of the united states therefore we have developed an active  strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies  enforce  their laws  defeat terrorist organizations  and cut off the supply of  drugs  while  as important  we work to reduce the demand for drugs  in our own country   in colombia  we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist  groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking  activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are  working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat  illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective  sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic  security to the colombian people   in africa  promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease  war   and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united  states  preserving human dignity  and our strategic priority   combating global terror american interests and american principles   therefore  lead in the same direction we will work with others for an  african continent that lives in liberty  peace  and growing prosperity  together with our european allies  we must help strengthen africas  fragile states  help build indigenous capability to secure porous  borders  and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence  infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists   an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars  spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions  of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to  confronting these emerging transnational threats   africas great size and diversity requires a security strategy that  focuses bilateral engagement  and builds coalitions of the willing this  administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the  region    countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south  africa  nigeria  kenya  and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement  and require focused attention    coordination with european allies and international institutions is  essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace  operations and    africas capable reforming states and subregional organizations  must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational  threats on a sustained basis    ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the  surest route to progress in subsaharan africa  where most wars are  conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically  waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to  the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a  common responsibility for democratic political systems offers  opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent   v prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our friends  with weapons of mass destruction    the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and  technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear  weapons  along with ballistic missile technology  when that occurs   even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to  strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention  and  have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the  capability to blackmail us  or to harm us  or to harm our friends  and  we will oppose them with all our power       president bush  west point  new york  june 1  2002     the nature of the cold war threat required the united states  with our  allies and friends  to emphasize deterrence of the enemys use of  force  producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the  collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war  our security  environment has undergone profound transformation   having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our  relationship with russia  the dividends are evident an end to the  balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear  arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as  counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were  inconceivable   but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists  none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power  that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however  the nature and  motivations of these new adversaries  their determination to obtain  destructive powers hitherto available only to the worlds strongest  states  and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass  destruction against us  make todays security environment more complex  and dangerous   in the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue  states that  while different in important ways  share a number of  attributes these states    brutalize their own people and squander their national resources  for the personal gain of the rulers    display no regard for international law  threaten their neighbors   and callously violate international treaties to which they are party    are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction  along with  other advanced military technology  to be used as threats or offensively  to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes    sponsor terrorism around the globe and    reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything  for which it stands    at the time of the gulf war  we acquired irrefutable proof that iraqs  designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against  iran and its own people  but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear  weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become  the worlds principal purveyor of ballistic missiles  and has tested  increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal  other rogue regimes seek nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons as  well these states pursuit of  and global trade in  such weapons has  become a looming threat to all nations   we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients  before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction  against the united states and our allies and friends our response must  take full advantage of strengthened alliances  the establishment of new  partnerships with former adversaries  innovation in the use of military  forces  modern technologies  including the development of an effective  missile defense system  and increased emphasis on intelligence  collection and analysis   our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes    proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend  against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key  capabilities  detection  active and passive defenses  and counterforce  capabilities  are integrated into our defense transformation and our  homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated  into the doctrine  training  and equipping of our forces and those of  our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmdarmed  adversaries    strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and  terrorists from acquiring the materials  technologies and expertise  necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy   arms control  multilateral export controls  and threat reduction  assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd  and when  necessary  interdict enabling technologies and materials we will  continue to build coalitions to support these efforts  encouraging their  increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and  threat reduction programs the recent g8 agreement to commit up to 20  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step  forward    effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd  use  whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of  wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such  weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading  enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states  must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our  forces abroad  and to help friends and allies if they are attacked    it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of  this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists  the  united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have  in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker  the immediacy  of todays threats  and the magnitude of potential harm that could be  caused by our adversaries choice of weapons  do not permit that option  we cannot let our enemies strike first    in the cold war  especially following the cuban missile crisis  we  faced a generally status quo  riskaverse adversary deterrence was an  effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of  retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states  more willing to take risks  gambling with the lives of their people  and  the wealth of their nations    in the cold war  weapons of mass destruction were considered  weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who  used them today  our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons  of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and  military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also  allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our  allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior  of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means  of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states    traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a  terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the  targeting of innocents whose socalled soldiers seek martyrdom in death  and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between  states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to  action    for centuries  international law recognized that nations need not suffer  an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves  against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars  and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption  on the existence of an imminent threat  most often a visible  mobilization of armies  navies  and air forces preparing to attack   we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and  objectives of todays adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not  seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would  fail instead  they rely on acts of terrorism and  potentially  the use  of weapons of mass destruction  weapons that can be easily concealed  and delivered covertly and without warning   the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian  population  in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law  of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september 11  2001   mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and  these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired  and used weapons of mass destruction   the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions  to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the  threat  the greater is the risk of inaction  and the more compelling  the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves  even if  uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack to  forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries  the united  states will  if necessary  act preemptively   the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging  threats  nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression  yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek  the worlds most destructive technologies  the united states cannot  remain idle while dangers gather   we will always proceed deliberately  weighing the consequences of our  actions to support preemptive options  we will    build better  more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide  timely  accurate information on threats  wherever they may emerge    coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the  most dangerous threats and    continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to  conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results    the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat  to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our  actions will be clear  the force measured  and the cause just   vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade    when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a  privileged few  no amount  no amount  of development aid is ever  enough when nations respect their people  open markets  invest in  better health and education  every dollar of aid  every dollar of trade  revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively       president bush  monterrey  mexico  march 22  2002     a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing  prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth  supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher  incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty  spurs  economic and legal reform  and the fight against corruption  and it  reinforces the habits of liberty   we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond americas  shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic  policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our  economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of  policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic  growth  including    progrowth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business  investment  innovation  and entrepreneurial activity    tax policies  particularly lower marginal tax rates  that  improve incentives for work and investment    rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are  confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic  endeavors    strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most  efficient use    sound fiscal policies to support business activity    investments in health and education that improve the wellbeing and  skills of the labor force and population as a whole and    free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the  diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and  opportunity    the lessons of history are clear market economies  not  commandandcontrol economies with the heavy hand of government  are the  best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further  strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for  all economies  industrialized countries  emerging markets  and the  developing world   a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to us  national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies  for their own sake  for the sake of the global economy  and for the sake  of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in  their economies are particularly important in this regard  as are  japans efforts to end deflation and address the problems of  nonperforming loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to  use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners   including through the group of seven g7  to discuss policies they  are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher  global economic growth   improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic  growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand  the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging  markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise  living standards and reduce poverty our longterm objective should be a  world in which all countries have investmentgrade credit ratings that  allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in  their future   we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve  access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end  we will  continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial  markets we will work actively with other countries  the international  monetary fund imf  and the private sector to implement the g7 action  plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and  more effectively resolving them when they occur   the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from  occurring  and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing  so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy  conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on  achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy   exchange rate policy  and financial sector policy   the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it  became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others  value  you should be able to sell it to them if others make something  that you value  you should be able to buy it this is real freedom  the  freedom for a person  or a nation  to make a living to promote free  trade  the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy    seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we  helped launch at doha in november 2001 will have an ambitious agenda   especially in agriculture  manufacturing  and services  targeted for  completion in 2005 the united states has led the way in completing the  accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade  organization we will assist russias preparations to join the wto    press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies  in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of  the americas  targeted for completion in 2005 this year the united  states will advocate marketaccess negotiations with its partners   targeted on agriculture  industrial goods  services  investment  and  government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the  poorest continent  africa  starting with full use of the preferences  allowed in the african growth and opportunity act  and leading to free  trade    move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the  free trade agreement with jordan enacted in 2001  the administration  will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and  singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of  developed and developing countries in all regions of the world  initially  central america  southern africa  morocco  and australia will  be our principal focal points    renew the executivecongressional partnership every  administrations trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with  congress after a gap of 8 years  the administration reestablished  majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing  trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for  developing countries in the trade act of 2002 this administration will  work with congress to enact new bilateral  regional  and global trade  agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade  promotion authority    promote the connection between trade and development trade  policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights   competition  the rule of law  investment  the spread of knowledge  open  societies  the efficient allocation of resources  and regional  integration  all leading to growth  opportunity  and confidence in  developing countries the united states is implementing the africa  growth and opportunity act to provide marketaccess for nearly all goods  produced in the 35 countries of subsaharan africa we will make more  use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue  to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer  countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access   the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public  health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are  flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical  medicines for extraordinary dangers like hivaids  tuberculosis  and  malaria    enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices  commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on  enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing  disputes with the european union  canada  and mexico and to make a  global effort to address new technology  science  and health regulations  that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws  against unfair trade practices are often abused  but the international  community must be able to address genuine concerns about government  subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which  undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred    help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound  statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used  in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the  american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the  enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that  the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american  workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the  change and dynamism of open markets    protect the environment and workers the united states must foster  economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with  widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental  concerns into us trade negotiations  creating a healthy network  between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto  and use the  international labor organization  trade preference programs  and trade  talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade    enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security  and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our  allies  trading partners  and energy producers to expand the sources and  types of global energy supplied  especially in the western hemisphere   africa  central asia  and the caspian region we will also continue to  work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient  technologies    economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize  greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth  containing  them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the  global climate our overall objective is to reduce americas greenhouse  gas emissions relative to the size of our economy  cutting such  emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10  years  by the year 2012 our strategies for attaining this goal will be  to    remain committed to the basic un framework convention for  international cooperation    obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of  the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to  companies that can show real cuts    develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission  reductions    promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology  as  well as nuclear power  which produces no greenhouse gas emissions   while also improving fuel economy for us cars and trucks    increase spending on research and new conservation technologies  to  a total of 45 billion  the largest sum being spent on climate change  by any country in the world and a 700 million increase over last years  budget and    assist developing countries  especially the major greenhouse gas  emitters such as china and india  so that they will have the tools and  resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and  better path    vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy    in world war ii we fought to make the world safer  then worked to  rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror  we  must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens       president bush  washington  dc interamerican  development bank  march 14  2002     a world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human  race lives on less than 2 a day  is neither just nor stable including  all of the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development  and  opportunity  is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of  us international policy   decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic  growth in the poorest countries worse  development aid has often served  to prop up failed policies  relieving the pressure for reform and  perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars  spent by donors  not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction  achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy   working with other nations  the united states is confronting this  failure we forged a new consensus at the un conference on financing  for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance  and  the strategies to achieve those objectives  must change   this administrations goal is to help unleash the productive potential  of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is  impossible without the right national policies where governments have  implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels  of assistance the united states and other developed countries should  set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the worlds  poorest economies within a decade   the united states government will pursue these major strategies to  achieve this goal    provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of  national reform we propose a 50 percent increase in the core  development assistance given by the united states while continuing our  present programs  including humanitarian assistance based on need alone   these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge  account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly  invest  in their people  and encourage economic freedom governments must fight  corruption  respect basic human rights  embrace the rule of law  invest  in health care and education  follow responsible economic policies  and  enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward  countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those  that have not to implement reforms    improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development  banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a  comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other  multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of  the worlds poor we have reversed the downward trend in us  contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the us  contributions to the international development association ida  the  world banks fund for the poorest countries  and the african  development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing  poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth  especially  in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral  development banks to focus on activities that increase economic  productivity  such as improvements in education  health  rule of law   and private sector development every project  every loan  every grant  must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in  developing countries    insist upon measurable results to ensure that development  assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the worlds  poor when it comes to economic development  what really matters is that  more children are getting a better education  more people have access to  health care and clean water  or more workers can find jobs to make a  better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure  the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering  results for this reason  we will continue to demand that our own  development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral  development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for  achieving those goals thanks to us leadership  the recent ida  replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation  system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time   donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the  achievement of actual development results  and part of the us  contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the  world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this  progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything  that these institutions do    increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in  the form of grants instead of loans greater use of resultsbased grants  is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments   particularly in the social sectors  without saddling them with  everlarger debt burdens as a result of us leadership  the recent ida  agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the  poorest countries for education  hivaids  health  nutrition  water   sanitation  and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress  by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development  banks we will also challenge universities  nonprofits  and the private  sector to match government efforts by using grants to support  development projects that show results    open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are  the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases   most money for development must come from trade  domestic capital  and  foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows  as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national  security strategy    secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor  countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics  like hivaids  malaria  and tuberculosis  growth and development will be  threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the  developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest  governance  which supports prevention programs and provides effective  local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new  global fund for hivaids organized by un secretary general kofi annan  and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for  treatment and care the united states already contributes more than  twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the  global fund demonstrates its promise  we will be ready to give even more    emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of  democracy and development only about 7 percent of world bank resources  are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states  will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher  training in africa the united states can also bring information  technology to these societies  many of whose education systems have been  devastated by aids    continue to aid agricultural development new technologies   including biotechnology  have enormous potential to improve crop yields  in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water  using sound science  the united states should help bring these benefits  to the 800 million people  including 300 million children  who still  suffer from hunger and malnutrition    viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers  of global power    we have our best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the 17th  century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead  of prepare for war       president bush  west point  new york  june 1  2002     america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions  as  broad as practicable  of states able and willing to promote a balance  of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires  clear priorities  an appreciation of others interests  and consistent  consultations among partners with a spirit of humility   there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can  accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies  and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the  strongest and most able international institutions in the world the  north atlantic treaty organization nato  which has  since its  inception  been the fulcrum of transatlantic and intereuropean  security  and the european union eu  our partner in opening world  trade   the attacks of september 11 were also an attack on nato  as nato itself  recognized when it invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the  first time natos core mission  collective defense of the  transatlantic alliance of democracies  remains  but nato must develop  new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new  circumstances nato must build a capability to field  at short notice   highly mobile  specially trained forces whenever they are needed to  respond to a threat against any member of the alliance   the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened   creating coalitions under natos own mandate  as well as contributing to  missionbased coalitions to achieve this  we must    expand natos membership to those democratic nations willing and  able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests    ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate  combat contributions to make in coalition warfare    develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become  effective multinational fighting forces    take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of  scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that  they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities    streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to  meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of  training  integrating  and experimenting with new force configurations  and    maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as  we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces    if nato succeeds in enacting these changes  the rewards will be a  partnership as central to the security and interests of its member  states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common  perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to  take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the  same time  we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater  foreign policy and defense identity with the eu  and commit ourselves to  close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we  cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of  transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come   the attacks of september 11 energized americas asian alliances  australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september 11 was an  attack on australia itself  following that historic decision with the  dispatch of some of the worlds finest combat forces for operation  enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented  levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist  attack we have deepened cooperation on counterterrorism with our  alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received  invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand   the war against terrorism has proven that americas alliances in asia  not only underpin regional peace and stability  but are flexible and  ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and  friendships  we will     look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and  global affairs based on our common interests  our common values  and our  close defense and diplomatic cooperation    work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while  preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of  the region over the longerterm    build on 50 years of usaustralian alliance cooperation as we  continue working together to resolve regional and global problems  as  we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora    maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our  allies  our requirements  our technological advances  and the strategic  environment and    build on stability provided by these alliances  as well as with  institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation  forum  to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage  change in this dynamic region    we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power  competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of  internal transition  most importantly russia  india  and china in all  three cases  recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly  global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape   with russia  we are already building a new strategic relationship based  on a central reality of the twentyfirst century the united states and  russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on  strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a  critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive   longterm relations with the euroatlantic community and the united  states russias top leaders have a realistic assessment of their  countrys current weakness and the policies  internal and external   needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand  increasingly  that  cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that  russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas   united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to  refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and  challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the  global war on terrorism we are facilitating russias entry into the  world trade organization  without lowering standards for accession  to  promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have  created the natorussia council with the goal of deepening security  cooperation among russia  our european allies  and ourselves we will  continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the  former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable  neighborhood will reinforce russias growing commitment to integration  into the euroatlantic community   at the same time  we are realistic about the differences that still  divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to  build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our  motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our  relations russias uneven commitment to the basic values of freemarket  democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russias very  weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless  those  opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years  or even  decades   the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral  relationship with india based on a conviction that us interests  require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest  democracies  committed to political freedom protected by representative  government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we  have a common interest in the free flow of commerce  including through  the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally  we share an interest  in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia   differences remain  including over the development of indias nuclear  and missile programs  and the pace of indias economic reforms but  while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about  india  today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with  which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership  with india  we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic  future   the united states relationship with china is an important part of our  strategy to promote a stable  peaceful  and prosperous asiapacific  region we welcome the emergence of a strong  peaceful  and prosperous  china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future  yet  a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst  features of the communist legacy  chinas leaders have not yet made the  next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state  in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its  neighbors in the asiapacific region  china is following an outdated  path that  in the end  will hamper its own pursuit of national  greatness in time  china will find that social and political freedom is  the only source of that greatness   the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing  china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap  including  the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean  peninsula likewise  we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan  and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism and  similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats   such as the spread of hivaids  challenge us to promote jointly the  welfare of our citizens   addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become  more open with information  promote the development of civil society   and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to  political openness  permitting many personal freedoms and conducting  villagelevel elections  yet remains strongly committed to national  oneparty rule by the communist party to make that nation truly  accountable to its citizens needs and aspirations  however  much work  remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think   assemble  and worship freely can china reach its full potential   our important trade relationship will benefit from chinas entry into  the world trade organization  which will create more export  opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers  workers   and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner  with over  100 billion in annual twoway trade the power of market principles and  the wtos requirements for transparency and accountability will advance  openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic  protections for commerce and for citizens there are  however  other  areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the  selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human  rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation  commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist  but  not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree   the events of september 11  2001  fundamentally changed the context for  relations between the united states and other main centers of global  power  and opened vast  new opportunities with our longstanding allies  in europe and asia  and with leaders in russia  india  and china  we  must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships  become routine and unproductive   every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we  can build fruitful habits of consultation  quiet argument  sober  analysis  and common action in the longterm  these are the practices  that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open  the path of progress   ix transform americas national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century    terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch  its source america is successful because of the hard work  creativity   and enterprise of our people       president bush  washington  dc joint session of congress  september 20  2001     the major institutions of american national security were designed in a  different era to meet different requirements all of them must be  transformed   it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength  we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our militarys  highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively   our military must    assure our allies and friends    dissuade future military competition    deter threats against us interests  allies  and friends and    decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails    the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces  and their  forward presence  have maintained the peace in some of the worlds most  strategically vital regions however  the threats and enemies we must  confront have changed  and so must our forces a military structured to  deter massive cold warera armies must be transformed to focus more on  how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might  occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational  challenges   the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound  symbols of the us commitments to allies and friends through our  willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others   the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of  power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the  many security challenges we face  the united states will require bases  and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia  as  well as temporary access arrangements for the longdistance deployment  of us forces   before the war in afghanistan  that area was low on the list of major  planning contingencies yet  in a very short time  we had to operate  across the length and breadth of that remote nation  using every branch  of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by  developing assets such as advanced remote sensing  longrange precision  strike capabilities  and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces  this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the  ability to defend the homeland  conduct information operations  ensure  us access to distant theaters  and protect critical us  infrastructure and assets in outer space   innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new  approaches to warfare  strengthening joint operations  exploiting us  intelligence advantages  and taking full advantage of science and  technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is  run  especially in financial management and recruitment and retention  finally  while maintaining nearterm readiness and the ability to fight  the war on terrorism  the goal must be to provide the president with a  wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of  coercion against the united states  our allies  and our friends   we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from  experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must  and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy   whether a state or nonstate actor  to impose its will on the united  states  our allies  or our friends we will maintain the forces  sufficient to support our obligations  and to defend freedom our forces  will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a  military buildup in hopes of surpassing  or equaling  the power of the  united states   intelligence  and how we use it  is our first line of defense  against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed  around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive   fixed object  the soviet bloc  the intelligence community is coping  with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of  targets   we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to  keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be  appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems  and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the  capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the  knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek  the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and  to maximize injury   we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide  integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since  the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted  inside the united states  we must also ensure the proper fusion of  information between intelligence and law enforcement   initiatives in this area will include    strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence  to lead the development and actions of the nations foreign intelligence  capabilities    establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides  seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing  the nation and our allies    continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to  sustain our intelligence advantage    investing in future capabilities while working to protect them  through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence  capabilities and    collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the  government with allsource analysis    as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend  americas interests  it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other  nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding  sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state  department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with  other governments and in this new era  its people and institutions must  be able to interact equally adroitly with nongovernmental organizations  and international institutions officials trained mainly in  international politics must also extend their reach to understand  complex issues of domestic governance around the world  including public  health  education  law enforcement  the judiciary  and public diplomacy   our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations  civil  wars  and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief  requirements are better understood  we must also be able to help build  police forces  court systems  and legal codes  local and provincial  government institutions  and electoral systems effective international  cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals  backed by american  readiness to play our part   just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out  to others  we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to  public information efforts that can help people around the world learn  about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of  civilizations it does  however  reveal the clash inside a civilization   a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas  and this is an area where america must excel   we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet  our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired  by the potential for investigations  inquiry  or prosecution by the  international criminal court icc  whose jurisdiction does not extend  to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with  other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and  cooperation  through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral  agreements that will protect us nationals from the icc we will  implement fully the american servicemembers protection act  whose  provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of us  personnel and officials   we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the  right level and allocation of government spending on national security  the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this  war at home  our most important priority is to protect the homeland for  the american people   today  the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is  diminishing in a globalized world  events beyond americas borders have  a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people  ideas   and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish   our freedom  our cities  our systems of movement  and modern life  are  vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we  bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks  as time passes  individuals may gain access to means of destruction that  until now could be wielded only by armies  fleets  and squadrons this  is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive  in spite  of it   in exercising our leadership  we will respect the values  judgment  and  interests of our friends and partners still  we will be prepared to act  apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we  disagree on particulars  we will explain forthrightly the grounds for  our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow  such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together  with  our allies and our friends  our shared fundamental interests and values   ultimately  the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the  skills of our people  the dynamism of our economy  and the resilience of  our institutions a diverse  modern society has inherent  ambitious   entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that  energy that is where our national security begins

823,0, ill agree that webforms are a pain in the ass  however it would seem to me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the autoform function  providing more info than you want to  that and some entity would be holding the passport info  thus have all that data in the first place personally id never trust them not to at least use it internally to market to me  if not sellrent out  just think of the ability theyd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was tracked to you  and thats just the marketing side of it chris on sat  28 sep 2002  gregory alan bolcer wrote  whats wrong with doing business over the web  web forms  theres  promising replacements forms  but this is the current state of the  industry    o you find something that you want to fill out  its a partnership form      a signup for a web seminar  a request for more information  anything   o you start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend     about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops     just to get a small piece of information   whitepaper  or a callback     when halfway through  you start to wonder if its really worth your     time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list   o pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized     i was on a site just now that had every single country in the world     listed the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you     to hit submit  but due to the layout  the more tag on the second     row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except     about two dozen third world countries   o even worse  ever time you hit submit  all forms based things complain     about using the universal country phone number format and will cause     you to reenter dashes instead of dots   o when you get something thats not entered right  you will go back and     enter it right  but then some other field or most likely pulldown will     automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to     go back and resent that freaking thing too  finally after all combinations     of all pulldowns  you may get a successful submit   o you wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation   o sometimes  like today  you wont be able to ever submit anything due     to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that     is internally nonconflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their     forms submission   whats wrong with this picture  the company is screwing you by wasting  your time enforcing their data collection standards on you  im sure theres  someone in that company that would be willing to accept us  us  usa  united states  u of a  america  etc and would know exactly which  freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them  to waste even more time playing web form geography   im starting to see the light of passport  you want more information  hit  this passport button  voila  ie6 and netscape 6 7 have preforms sutff   but i always turn it off because you never know when theres that one field  that you dont want to submit to the person you are submitting to that  automatically gets sent  ie the privacy stuff is well beyond the  average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff   so  if crappy formsbased submission is the state of practice for  business enablement on the web  i cant see this whole data submission  and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as  working all that well    greg

828,0, glad they finally figured this one out note the very careful wording  so exhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day with some cheese interesting timing  since 16 000 truckers just lost their jobs and dont have to worry about death from this anymore  adam l duncan beberg httpwwwmithralcombeberg bebergmithralcom  epa diesel exhaust can cause cancer wed sep 4  329 am et by h josef hebert  associated press writer washington ap  inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans  an environmental protection agency  news  web sites report concludes after a decade of study the epa finding  released tuesday  is expected to buttress the governments push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleanerburning engines and diesel fuel with ultralow sulfur content while acknowledging uncertainties about the longterm health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts  the epa report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans it is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels as well  the report said the potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive  even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved the report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in california and is particularly significant because the epa is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the clean air act some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the bush administration might try to back away from a clintonera regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel epa administrator christie whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules last month  with white house approval  the epa rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements  approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an october deadline for making cleanerburning truck engines the engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road  although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions the epas 651page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer  given certain exposure to diesel exhaust such a risk assessment is commonly made by the epa when gauging pollution health concerns but in this case  the report said  the exposureresponse data are considered too uncertain to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual nevertheless  said the report  the totality of evidence from human  animal and other supporting studies suggests that diesel exhaust is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation  and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure the report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses shortterm health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a chronic respiratory hazard to humans contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems in some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot  the report said environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from offroad dieselpowered vehicles epa spokeswoman steffanie bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources  which include farm tractors and construction equipment emily figdor of the us public interest research group  a private environmental organization  said to reduce the publics exposure to harmful diesel emissions  the bush administration should  fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment allen schaeffer  executive director of the industry group diesel technology forum  said the epas report focused on the past  whereas the future is clean diesel diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago the report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mid1990s  but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road

830,0, well  ive used the checkthemodifytime cache trick for files in many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective  however  it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state  then arent we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read  perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view  just idle speculation  we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log we could make that conditional on some support available in 83  tcl has had clock seconds like gettimeofday and clock clicks high resolution timer for some time  but in 83 weve calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds  it is still only useful for relative times  but each call to exmhlog could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record  of course  we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record  etc  ill try it out chris garrigues said   from  brent welch welchpanasascom   date  wed  28 aug 2002 103242 0700       robert elz said     mhsequence also goes and rereads the files mhsequences and the     context file but im not sure how frequently that one is called     in some places i maintain caches of files by checking their modify  time    but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to   check their date stamp  you could just read them again   do you really think this is true  i added a modify time check thinking  that  it would make an improvement since we were reading it a lot more times  in  the new code because were trying to use the sequences   on the other hand  the sequences files are probably being read out of  cache  when that happens anyway   even with a small file  id think that the time taken to do a  file mtime filename would be worth it  my code is in proc  mhreadseqs   chris     chris garrigues                 httpwwwdeepeddycomcwg  vircio                          httpwwwvirciocom  716 congress  suite 200  austin  tx  787011 512 374 0500     world war iii  the wrongdoers vs the evildoers    brent welch software architect  panasas inc pioneering the worlds most scalable and agile storage network wwwpanasascom welchpanasascom  exmhworkers mailing list exmhworkersredhatcom httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhworkers

851,0, what i understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for the food and other items they acquired from the muslim vendors  then taunted them that may not be true  but it would put things in a more interesting light  taking food from a small vendor in india and not paying them is trying to starve them it sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of activists im rarely an apologist for muslims anywhere  yet i find my sympathies with the muslims in this case  even after they burned the train  from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of  stephen d williams  the pity of it is that some  muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the  trainload of vhp activists at godhra with its awful  atavistic echoes  of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the  partition riots of 1947 played right into the hindu extremists hands

859,0,  a world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human  race lives on less than 2 a day  is neither just nor stable absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world   the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does   however  reveal the clash inside a civilization  a battle for the  future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an  area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa  our new musicandnews channel for 1530 year old arabs its 1 in practically every market its entered  nearing 90 listenership in amman and its even beginning to be trusted for news  well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the longterm as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree  but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code  you can hear clearly partisan tones  re icc  taiwan relations act  etc but  still  this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read  replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense  in the long view of history i dont know how proud to be about that  but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700 military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us heck  id love to see a realtime map of federal expenditures around the globe  a softly glowing necklace of embassies  carriers  arctic research stations  hotels  golf courses  warehouses  libraries  clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy of course  this still doesnt leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for preemptive strikes id sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit  september 20  2002 full text bushs national security strategy following is the full text of president bushs new national security strategy the document  entitled the national security strategy of the united states  will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administrations policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom  and a single sustainable model for national success freedom  democracy  and free enterprise in the twentyfirst century  only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children  male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person  in every society  and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedomloving people across the globe and across the ages today  the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles  we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer  we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today  that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now  shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal  from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror  because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together  we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction  and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny  contain  and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and  as a matter of common sense and selfdefense  america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans  using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered  the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace  we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today  the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today  the worlds great powers find ourselves on the same side  united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition  reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time  they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations  because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers  even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity  trade  and cultural advancement finally  the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy  development  free markets  and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september 11  2001  taught us that weak states  like afghanistan  can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty  weak institutions  and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty  so the united states will work with individual nations  entire regions  and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly  invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom  the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely  so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive  accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer  better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedomloving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations  the world trade organization  the organization of american states  and nato as well as other longstanding alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases  international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person  in every civilization throughout history  freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today  humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedoms triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of americas international strategy our nations cause has always been larger than our nations defense we fight  as we always fight  for a just peace  a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point  new york june 1  2002 the united states possesses unprecedented  and unequaled  strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty  and the value of a free society  this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities  obligations  and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century  the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class  nation  and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation  allies  and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace  prosperity  and liberty the us national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom  peaceful relations with other states  and respect for human dignity and this path is not americas alone it is open to all to achieve these goals  the united states will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our friends  with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods  but not different moralities president bush west point  new york june 1  2002 in pursuit of our goals  our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations  and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed  aspire to servitude  or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways americas constitution has served us well many other nations  with different histories and cultures  facing different circumstances  have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments  the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result  america is not just a stronger  but is a freer and more just society today  these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive  we can encourage change  as we did in central and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991  or in belgrade in 2000 when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea  and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa  we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve  marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today  the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our governments decisions about international cooperation  the character of our foreign assistance  and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle nonviolently for it  ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations  seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events  americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful  but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way  and at an hour  of our choosing president bush washington  dc the national cathedral september 14  2001 the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism  premeditated  politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions  legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be  and must be  addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes  some seen  some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can  and will  do against regimes that harbor  support  and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and alqaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america  south america  europe  africa  the middle east  and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command  control  and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state  we will help ensure the state has the military  law enforcement  political  and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism  freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them  deny terrorists access to the international financial system  protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists  and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however  this campaign need not be sequential to be effective  the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors defending the united states  the american people  and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community  we will not hesitate to act alone  if necessary  to exercise our right of selfdefense by acting preemptively against such terrorists  to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship  support  and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes using the full influence of the united states  and working closely with allies and friends  to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery  piracy  or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government  especially in the muslim world  to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening americas homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi  our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example  emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror  but all infectious diseases and masscasualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists  but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america  we know that to defeat terrorism in todays globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible  the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities  we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan  we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations  as well as nongovernmental organizations  and other countries to provide the humanitarian  political  economic  and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people  threaten its neighbors  and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism  we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war  and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism  we are forging new  productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice  or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin  germany may 23  2002 concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world  regional crisis can strain our alliances  rekindle rivalries among the major powers  and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter  the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which us action  direct or indirect  is warranted we have finite political  economic  and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part  we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israelipalestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering  because of americas close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states  and because of that regions importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine  living beside israel in peace and security like all other people  palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests  and listens to their voices  and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states  the international donor community  and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development  increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish  finance  and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy  and the rule of law  confront corruption  and firmly reject terror  they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israels identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable  credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security  israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september 28  2000 and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee  israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides  freedom of movement should be restored  permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but  ultimately  lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia  the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan  our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistans choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees indias potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twentyfirst century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute  building on earlier investments in bilateral relations  looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities  respecting the rule of law  and accepting open markets  indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows us assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities  particularly mexico  brazil  canada  chile  and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security  prosperity  opportunity  and hope we will work with regional institutions  such as the summit of the americas process  the organization of american states oas  and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict  especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies  enforce their laws  defeat terrorist organizations  and cut off the supply of drugs  while  as important  we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia  we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa  promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease  war  and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states  preserving human dignity  and our strategic priority  combating global terror american interests and american principles  therefore  lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty  peace  and growing prosperity together with our european allies  we must help strengthen africas fragile states  help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders  and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africas great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement  and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa  nigeria  kenya  and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and africas capable reforming states and subregional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in subsaharan africa  where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons  along with ballistic missile technology  when that occurs  even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention  and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us  or to harm us  or to harm our friends  and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point  new york june 1  2002 the nature of the cold war threat required the united states  with our allies and friends  to emphasize deterrence of the enemys use of force  producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war  our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia  the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however  the nature and motivations of these new adversaries  their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the worlds strongest states  and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us  make todays security environment more complex and dangerous in the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that  while different in important ways  share a number of attributes these states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law  threaten their neighbors  and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction  along with other advanced military technology  to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war  we acquired irrefutable proof that iraqs designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people  but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the worlds principal purveyor of ballistic missiles  and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of  and global trade in  such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances  the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries  innovation in the use of military forces  modern technologies  including the development of an effective missile defense system  and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities  detection  active and passive defenses  and counterforce capabilities  are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine  training  and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmdarmed adversaries strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials  technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy  arms control  multilateral export controls  and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd  and when necessary  interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts  encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g8 agreement to commit up to 20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use  whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad  and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists  the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker  the immediacy of todays threats  and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons  do not permit that option we cannot let our enemies strike first in the cold war  especially following the cuban missile crisis  we faced a generally status quo  riskaverse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks  gambling with the lives of their people  and the wealth of their nations in the cold war  weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today  our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose socalled soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries  international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat  most often a visible mobilization of armies  navies  and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of todays adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead  they rely on acts of terrorism and  potentially  the use of weapons of mass destruction  weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population  in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september 11  2001  mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat  the greater is the risk of inaction  and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves  even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries  the united states will  if necessary  act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats  nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the worlds most destructive technologies  the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately  weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options  we will build better  more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely  accurate information on threats  wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear  the force measured  and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few  no amount  no amount  of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people  open markets  invest in better health and education  every dollar of aid  every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey  mexico march 22  2002 a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty  spurs economic and legal reform  and the fight against corruption  and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond americas shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth  including progrowth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment  innovation  and entrepreneurial activity tax policies  particularly lower marginal tax rates  that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the wellbeing and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies  not commandandcontrol economies with the heavy hand of government  are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies  industrialized countries  emerging markets  and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to us national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake  for the sake of the global economy  and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard  as are japans efforts to end deflation and address the problems of nonperforming loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners  including through the group of seven g7  to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our longterm objective should be a world in which all countries have investmentgrade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end  we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries  the international monetary fund imf  and the private sector to implement the g7 action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring  and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy  exchange rate policy  and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value  you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value  you should be able to buy it this is real freedom  the freedom for a person  or a nation  to make a living to promote free trade  the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november 2001 will have an ambitious agenda  especially in agriculture  manufacturing  and services  targeted for completion in 2005 the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization we will assist russias preparations to join the wto press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas  targeted for completion in 2005 this year the united states will advocate marketaccess negotiations with its partners  targeted on agriculture  industrial goods  services  investment  and government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent  africa  starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act  and leading to free trade move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in 2001  the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world initially  central america  southern africa  morocco  and australia will be our principal focal points renew the executivecongressional partnership every administrations trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress after a gap of 8 years  the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of 2002 this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral  regional  and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority promote the connection between trade and development trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights  competition  the rule of law  investment  the spread of knowledge  open societies  the efficient allocation of resources  and regional integration  all leading to growth  opportunity  and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide marketaccess for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of subsaharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access  the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hivaids  tuberculosis  and malaria enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union  canada  and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology  science  and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused  but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into us trade negotiations  creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto  and use the international labor organization  trade preference programs  and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies  trading partners  and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied  especially in the western hemisphere  africa  central asia  and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth  containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy  cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years  by the year 2012 our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic un framework convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology  as well as nuclear power  which produces no greenhouse gas emissions  while also improving fuel economy for us cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies  to a total of 45 billion  the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a 700 million increase over last years budget and assist developing countries  especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india  so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy in world war ii we fought to make the world safer  then worked to rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror  we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens president bush washington  dc interamerican development bank march 14  2002 a world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day  is neither just nor stable including all of the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development  and opportunity  is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of us international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse  development aid has often served to prop up failed policies  relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors  not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations  the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the un conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance  and the strategies to achieve those objectives  must change this administrations goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the worlds poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs  including humanitarian assistance based on need alone  these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly  invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption  respect basic human rights  embrace the rule of law  invest in health care and education  follow responsible economic policies  and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the worlds poor we have reversed the downward trend in us contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the us contributions to the international development association ida  the world banks fund for the poorest countries  and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth  especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity  such as improvements in education  health  rule of law  and private sector development every project  every loan  every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the worlds poor when it comes to economic development  what really matters is that more children are getting a better education  more people have access to health care and clean water  or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason  we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to us leadership  the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time  donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results  and part of the us contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of resultsbased grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments  particularly in the social sectors  without saddling them with everlarger debt burdens as a result of us leadership  the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education  hivaids  health  nutrition  water  sanitation  and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities  nonprofits  and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases  most money for development must come from trade  domestic capital  and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hivaids  malaria  and tuberculosis  growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance  which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hivaids organized by un secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise  we will be ready to give even more emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about 7 percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies  many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids continue to aid agricultural development new technologies  including biotechnology  have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science  the united states should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people  including 300 million children  who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point  new york june 1  2002 america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions  as broad as practicable  of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities  an appreciation of others interests  and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato  which has  since its inception  been the fulcrum of transatlantic and intereuropean security  and the european union eu  our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september 11 were also an attack on nato  as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the first time natos core mission  collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies  remains  but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field  at short notice  highly mobile  specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened  creating coalitions under natos own mandate  as well as contributing to missionbased coalitions to achieve this  we must expand natos membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training  integrating  and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes  the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time  we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu  and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september 11 energized americas asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september 11 was an attack on australia itself  following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the worlds finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counterterrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that americas alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability  but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships  we will look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests  our common values  and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longerterm build on 50 years of usaustralian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems  as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies  our requirements  our technological advances  and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances  as well as with institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation forum  to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition  most importantly russia  india  and china in all three cases  recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia  we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twentyfirst century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive  longterm relations with the euroatlantic community and the united states russias top leaders have a realistic assessment of their countrys current weakness and the policies  internal and external  needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand  increasingly  that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russias entry into the world trade organization  without lowering standards for accession  to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the natorussia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia  our european allies  and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russias growing commitment to integration into the euroatlantic community at the same time  we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russias uneven commitment to the basic values of freemarket democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russias very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless  those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years  or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that us interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies  committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce  including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally  we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain  including over the development of indias nuclear and missile programs  and the pace of indias economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india  today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india  we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable  peaceful  and prosperous asiapacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong  peaceful  and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet  a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy  chinas leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asiapacific region  china is following an outdated path that  in the end  will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time  china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap  including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise  we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats  such as the spread of hivaids  challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information  promote the development of civil society  and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness  permitting many personal freedoms and conducting villagelevel elections  yet remains strongly committed to national oneparty rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizens needs and aspirations  however  much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think  assemble  and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from chinas entry into the world trade organization  which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers  workers  and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner  with over 100 billion in annual twoway trade the power of market principles and the wtos requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are  however  other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist  but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september 11  2001  fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power  and opened vast  new opportunities with our longstanding allies in europe and asia  and with leaders in russia  india  and china  we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation  quiet argument  sober analysis  and common action in the longterm  these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work  creativity  and enterprise of our people president bush washington  dc joint session of congress september 20  2001 the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our militarys highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively  our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against us interests  allies  and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces  and their forward presence  have maintained the peace in some of the worlds most strategically vital regions however  the threats and enemies we must confront have changed  and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold warera armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the us commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others  the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face  the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia  as well as temporary access arrangements for the longdistance deployment of us forces before the war in afghanistan  that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet  in a very short time  we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation  using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing  longrange precision strike capabilities  and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland  conduct information operations  ensure us access to distant theaters  and protect critical us infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare  strengthening joint operations  exploiting us intelligence advantages  and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run  especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally  while maintaining nearterm readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism  the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states  our allies  and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy  whether a state or nonstate actor  to impose its will on the united states  our allies  or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations  and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing  or equaling  the power of the united states intelligence  and how we use it  is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive  fixed object  the soviet bloc  the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states  we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nations foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with allsource analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend americas interests  it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era  its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with nongovernmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world  including public health  education  law enforcement  the judiciary  and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations  civil wars  and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood  we must also be able to help build police forces  court systems  and legal codes  local and provincial government institutions  and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals  backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others  we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does  however  reveal the clash inside a civilization  a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations  inquiry  or prosecution by the international criminal court icc  whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation  through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect us nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act  whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of us personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home  our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today  the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world  events beyond americas borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people  ideas  and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish  our freedom  our cities  our systems of movement  and modern life  are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes  individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies  fleets  and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive  in spite of it in exercising our leadership  we will respect the values  judgment  and interests of our friends and partners still  we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars  we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together  with our allies and our friends  our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately  the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people  the dynamism of our economy  and the resilience of our institutions a diverse  modern society has inherent  ambitious  entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins

909,0,  please feel free to forward this message to other possiblyinterested  parties some caveats in decending order of concern 1 these messages could end up being falsely or incorrectly reported to razor  dcc  pyzor  etc  certain rbls too  i dont think the results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way  shape  or form when running over a public corpus 2 these messages could also be submitted more than once to projects like spamassassin that rely on filtering results submission for ga tuning and development 3 spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off filters  and  of course  theres always progression in technology by both spammers and nonspammers the second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a nilsimsa signature or similar to the masscheck file the results format used by spamassassin and giving the message files unique names md5 or sha1 of each file the third problem doesnt really worry me these problems and perhaps others i have not identified are unique to spam filtering  compression corpuses and other performancerelated corpuses have their own set of problems  of course in other words  i dont think theres any replacement for having multiple independent corpuses  finding better ways to distribute testing and collate results seems like a more viable longterm solution and im glad were working on exactly that for spamassassin  if youre going to seriously work on filter development  building a corpus of 1000050000 messages half spamhalf nonspam is not really that much work  if you dont get enough spam  creating multitechnique spamtraps web  usenet  replying to spam is pretty easy  and who doesnt get thousands of nonspam every week   dan

966,0, i agree with rob i think if the phones and mms is building traction in europe in handsets  this might be interesting bottom line is will it a help sell phones and b bill enough time on the wcarriers networks anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad low quality  small in size but kids totally dug that stuff seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs i dont think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography  developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc i think it expands the market and forms a new category the extent of the category size is the big question will it be a fad or will it a sustained market thats consumer behavior and marketing but i dont think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market in this case  digital photos or normal photos europes the one to watch  more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right  theyll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them h from rob shavell robmobiusvccom to mike masnick miketechdirtcom cc forkexamplecom subject re sprint delivers the next big thing date wed  21 aug 2002 011050 0700  right mike   i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart  my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing  i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting  my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eyes which can instantly share what they see amongst each other  that doesnt mean that people will stop talking on their phones  or that people will spend more time wimages than voice  just that it is fundamental  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes  i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes  changes things big time  rgds  rob   original message from mike masnick mailtomiketechdirtcom sent tuesday  august 20

content  that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications  its anything and everything  avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day  mainly humorous id guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words  this does nothing to answer my question  i do care about content  hell  if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day  id have a different opinion of this  i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not  while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made  how many people do you know who communicate by pictures  sure  it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism  but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something  i dont buy it  for most messages  text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism  for some messages  pictures do the job  but i would say not nearly as often as words  why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games  because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across  misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about 1 hour photo processing  trivial  who needs it  i get better resultion elswhere  and yet  it had great decentralizing impact  the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation  the digital camera  and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way  also  sms didnt take off because its easy  it took off because it costs less  its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth  in reality  sms cannibilizes the voice revs they bought their networks to handle  again  this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just dont understand kids today  and theyll run with this  i wasnt saying that mms wouldnt take off because it wasnt high quality or that it wasnt easy  i was saying that i couldnt see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications  im looking for the compelling reason even if its a stupid one why people would want to do this  sure  if they integrate cameras into the phone  and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people  but  mostly  i dont see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someones email address  or putting together an online or offline photoalbum  i dont think 1 hour photos are trivial  people want to see their own pics right away  and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots  thats one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on  the instant view part  im guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view  but also instant show  which is what this service offers  im not convinced that most people want instant show  i think people like to package their pictures and show them  thats why people put together fancy albums  and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture  sure  occasionally instant show is nice  but its just nice on occasion  i still cant see how it becomes a integral messaging method  whats the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another  there has to be some benefit  even if its silly if people are going to flock to it  im searching no one has given me a straight answer yet  the only really intriguing idea ive heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmors assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen  and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones  from all different angles  and those photos tell the real story of what happened  before the press even gets there  willing to be proven wrong  mike  ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are  then mms is never going to catch on

983,0, me  spam is the tool for dissident news  since the fact that its unsolicited  means that recipients cant be blamed for being on a mailing list  russell turpin  that depends on how the list is collected  or  even on what the senders say about how the list  is collected better to just put it on a website   and that way it can be surfed anonymously and  it doesnt clutter my inbox it doesnt work that way  a website is optin  spam is noopt  if you visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble  if you get samizdat spam  the worst that can be said is that you might have read it  and as long as the mailers send to individuals who clearly didnt optin  like party officials  then other recipients cant get in trouble for requesting the mail plus  its much harder to block spam than web sites but this shouldnt come as a surprize  spam is speech  it may be sleazy  but so what  lucas httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork 
984,0, gordon mohr it was clear you were talking about averages but it should be equally clear that that isnt what people mean when they use the word promiscuity sigh this sprung out of a report linked by cindy about the promiscuity of female monkeys with males other than the alpha male  ie  specifically not the tail end of the distribution  by mating with as many extragroup males as possible  female langurs ensure etc ok  then consider a population of 1 000 000 500 000 men each pair off with 500 000 women then  1 man  lets call him wilt  also has sex with the other 499 999 women this has never happened  its relevance is nil averages are useful  sure  but much more so if called by their actual name  rather than conflated with another concept so i chose not to type on average explicitly in my post  since this is fork and one tends to assume that people have a clue there is no disagreement between us  except that i am more interested in typical behaviour and you in extreme  actually  you probably just had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it eot  afaic r

1007,0, hi kragen  this is an interesting analysis  i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick for example  i dont expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while  i think that the most important issue  which is that end users wont be able to fix their systems  is almost passed over  i know that you know this  and you allude to it  but your essay is getting passed around  so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others theres one other point which you dont make  which i think is very important  which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities cant happen without libraries of available vulnerability code  i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped  uninvited  about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites  doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples  in the open  that you can define a set  and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure  we wouldnt have stackguard  its4  nissus  or snort  and the security admins job would be a lot harder adam on thu  aug 22  2002 at 084212am 0200  eugen leitl wrote     eugen leitl a hrefhttpleitlorgleitla    icbmto n48 04148 e11 36412 httpeugenleitlorg  83e5ca02 ede4

vulnerability marketplace and its hazards   on august 7th  an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement   which is appended to this email  briefly  idefense  which bills  itself as a global security intelligence company  is offering cash  for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software  that are not publicly known  especially if you promise not to tell  anyone else   if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue  it will pose a  very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure   at the moment  the dominant paradigm for computer security research  known as full disclosure people who discover security  vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them  and a short  while later  after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem   they publish the information  including code to exploit the  vulnerability  if possible   this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by  cert in the late 1980s  which its proponents might call responsible  disclosure  never release working exploit code  and never release  any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released  a patch  this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers  vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked  on features  and often  even after the patches were released  people  wouldnt apply them because they didnt know how serious the problem  was   the underground computer criminal community would often discover and  exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible  disclosure process kept their victims  who had no connections in the  underground  vulnerable   the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known  are much less dangerous  because their victims can take steps to  reduce their potential impact  including disabling software   turning off vulnerable features  filtering traffic in transit  and  detecting and responding to intrusions  they are therefore much less  useful to wouldbe intruders  also  software companies usually see  security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems  and so  prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as  long as possible   idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous  than either of the two previous paradigms  they want to be a buyer in  a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information  rewarding  discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash   not long before  snosoft  a group of security researchers evidently  including some criminal elements  apparently made an offer to sell the  secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software  vendor specifically  they apparently made a private offer to  hewlettpackard to keep a vulnerability in hps tru64 unix secret if  hp retained snosofts consulting services  hp considered this  extortion and responded with legal threats  and snosoft published the  information   if this is allowed to happen  it will cause two problems which   together  add up to a catastrophe   first  secret software vulnerability information will be available to  the highest bidder  and to nobody else  for reasons explained later   i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime  syndicates  although that will not be obvious to the sellers   second  finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will  become lucrative for many more talented people  the result will be   just as in the responsible disclosure days  that the good  guys will remain vulnerable for months and years  while the majority  of current vulnerabilities are kept secret   ive heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the  vendors of the vulnerable software  but i dont think thats  plausible  if someone can steal 20 000 because a software bug lets  them  the software vendor is never held liable often  in fact  the  people who administer the software arent liable  either  when  credit card data are stolen from an ecommerce site  for example  knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a website  administrator some time  and it might save the software vendor some  negative pr  but it can net the thief thousands of dollars   i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability  information is most lucrative  the thieves who can use it to  execute the largest heists without getting caught  inevitably  that  means organized crime syndicates  although the particular gangs who  are good at networked theft may not yet exist   there might be the occasional case where a market leader  such as  microsoft  could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr  than a gang could make by theft  think of a remoteroot hole in  samba  for example   right now  people who know how to find security exploits are either  motivated by personal interest in the subject  motivated by the public  interest  motivated by a desire for individual recognition  or  personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits  creating  a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly  increase the availability of that information to the people who can  afford to pay the most for it spies  terrorists  and organized crime   lets not let that happen      this is the original idefense announcement   from sunil james mailtosjamesidefensecom  sent wednesday  august 07  2002 1232 pm  subject introducing idefenses vulnerability contributor program    greetings    idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability  contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance  notification of vulnerabilities  exploit code and malicious code   idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following  provides answers to some basic questions about the program   q how will it work  a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish  security research for compensation rather  it could be for any of a number  of motivations  including the following             pure love of security research            the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks            the desire to urge vendors to fix their products            the publicity that often accompanies disclosure   the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the  internet community  but who would also like to be paid for doing the  workthe compensation will depend  among other things  on the following  items             the kind of information being shared ie vulnerability or exploit            the amount of detail and analysis provided            the potential severity level for the information shared            the types of applications  operating systems  and other             software and hardware potentially affected            verification by idefense labs            the level of exclusivity  if any  for data granted to idefense   q who should contribute to the vcp  a the vcp is open to any individual  security research group or other  entity   q why are you launching this program  a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions  to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more  often  many of these services charge clients for access without paying the  original contributor under the idefense program  the contributor is  compensated  idefense labs verifies the issue  and idefense clients and the  public at large are warned in a timely manner   q who gets the credit  a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or  exploit information   q when can i contribute  the vcp is active you are welcome to begin

rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago but we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one the site of the world trade center calls forth many emotions  especially today anger  grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there but underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted the best expression of the spirit of new york and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working  meeting  shopping  eating  that is  engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there osama bin laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery but restoring this memory is not what the discussion in new york has been about so far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown manhattan  which lost 100 000 jobs when the trade center fell instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial  and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action new yorks political leadership  and its financial and media elites  are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better  more prosperous city this is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site in consultation with new york governor george pataki  who is thinking primarily about his own november reelection  the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial the manhattan institutes steve malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial  getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial this is in essence what the pentagon has so successfully done  rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial  a design for which has yet to be decided a big part of the problem in new york is that the citys antidevelopment activists know an opening when they see one they want the world trade center site  and even some surrounding areas   transformed into an enormous park these political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in new york into a nightmare of delay and litigation  and the world trade center site is now getting the same treatment worse  they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own antidevelopment agenda in the name of honoring the dead one family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site we are not experts in designing war memorials  but were confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the worlds financial center isnt the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago the great cities of europe and japan  devastated in world war ii  have all rebuilt  and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life perhaps the most powerful is found in rotterdam  the dutch port city reduced to rubble by german bombing  where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be in this country  the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated if you walk into nassau hall at princeton university  youll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the revolutionary war  the war of 1812  the civil war  the spanishamerican war  world war i  world war ii  korea and southeast asia no one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names in new york now  it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the citys future rudolph giuliani  now that hes out office  wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial governor pataki has called for no structures on the footprints  which  being in the center of the site  would severely curtail options mayor michael bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past maybe those responsible for the world trade center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months the best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce begin pgp signature version pgp 75 iqaawubpx9zd8pxh8jf3ohaeqi2aacgv7mtb5vktprj5mjqt1oyzyifzusan273 fgnkontna6smlo8tb4xybc2

1101,0,  the only circumstances in which a business will not be readyindeed   eagerto do an additional volume of business is if it is physically unable  to do so because it lacks the necessary physical means of doing so  or  because the costs it incurs in doing so exceed the additional sales revenue  it will receive that is a fully retarded view of economics  and pretty much the same kind of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts  there are a bazillion factors that affect game strategies  which is what the state of california messed up and the energy producers exploited im not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like the blackouts is to reregulate  ultimately we have to blame the people who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and exploitation  given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state of california sucked  does there exist a set of rules that doesnt suck if there does exist a better set of rules  then reregulation isnt necessarily the answer you cant blame businesses for being profit maximizers  yes  the people involved were heartless and corrupt  but mainly they just did their jobs the guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote the rules or  if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good rules  proderegulation politicians who went ahead anyway  lucas

1121,0, neale pickett  i hacked up something to turn wordinfo into a tuple before pickling  thats what wordinfogetstate does  and then turn the tuple back into wordinfo right after unpickling likewise for wordinfosetstate  without this hack  my database was 21549056 bytes  after  its 9945088 bytes  thats a 50 savings  not a bad optimization im not sure what youre doing  but suspect youre storing individual wordinfo pickles  if so  most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to that  and doesnt happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance directly  so my question is  would it be too painful to ditch wordinfo in favor of  a straight out tuple  or list if youd rather  although making it a  tuple has the nice sideeffect of forcing you to play nice with my  dbdict class   i hope doing this sort of optimization isnt too far distant from the  goal of this project  even though readmetxt says it is    diff attached  im not comfortable checking this in  i think its healthy that youre uncomfortable checking things in with               xxx kludge kludge kludge comments wink  since i dont really like how it works id rather just get rid of wordinfo  but i guess it proves the point  im not interested in optimizing anything yet  and get many benefits from the ease of working with utterly vanilla python instance objects  lots of code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes  very few people have tried this code yet  and there are still many questions about it see  eg  jeremys writeup of his disappointing firsttime experiences today  lets keep it as easy as possible to modify for now  if youre desparate to save memory  write a subclass other people are free to vote in other directions  of course wink

1135,0, so  like many young children  my daughter tatum age 21 months really likes music she also likes to have control over her environment  and this means she wants to be the one putting cds into the cd player  and getting the music playing by watching tatum  ive discovered that you can learn a lot about ui design from watching 21montholds use technology there is definitely a market niche for a toddlerfriendly cdmp3 player the cd player we have combines play and pause in a single button  but doesnt provide instantaneous feedback that the button was pushed  instead requiring you to wait until the music starts  510 seconds this is a ui disaster since tatum doesnt get feedback right away  she presses the button again  thereby pausing the cd before it even plays shell only ever get music if she presses the button an odd number of times this happens a surprising amount of the time  since she eventually hits the button again when the music doesnt play for toddlers  pressing play must cause the music to start immediately  within half a second  for the toddler to get the causality and not press the button multiple times as well  pressing the button multiple times shouldnt change the semantics  like an elevator button no matter how many times you press  the elevator still comes to that floor the play button needs to be the same the backhinged door mechanism feeding the cd into the player is also a ui disaster for tatum since the door hinges on the back  tatum has to angle cds to put them in  and take them out putting cds in isnt much of a problem  but taking them out is since tatum grabs cds by the back edge  that edge comes out first  hitting the lid tatum eventually forces and wiggles the cd out  a process thats hard on the cd and the player but which hasnt yet resulted in the cd player being broken surprisingly  it hasnt been a problem getting the cd hole onto the spindle  tatum seems to understand this concept  and the cd load area geometry naturally guides the cd tatums cd player also plays tapes and has fm radio for a toddler  this is a mistake tatum doesnt understand the need to flick a switch to put the player into a specific mode she understands putting a cd in  and pressing the play button she sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song  but uses them erratically as well  the radio feature has both fm mono and fm stero  a distinction totally lost on tatum tatum only understands the binary distinction of musicno music what would the ideal toddler cd player be like it would immediately start playing a cd after it was loaded as soon as the cd load door was closed  it would give some audible feedback it would have a single large play button the other typical cd controls would be larger than normal  but at least half the size of the play button  and located far away from the play button  so there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play the play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of the player  and different from the color of the other cd control keys the device would only play cds  no other functions the cd load area would flip open at least 80 degrees it should be small  approachable for a toddler it should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 12 without affecting the player  jim

1157,0, hi all  ive decided at last to test the alsa sound drivers as usual the result is that ive spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs but hey  some of you will benefit from that  right  ive got the whole thing working on a valhalla system  but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on enigma  limbonull and maybe others  who knows  here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out   recompile the alsadriver source rpm for your running kernel you can install the binary package if youre using the i686 241810  install this alsadriver package  install the alsalibs package  install the alsautils package now go to this url and find out what you need to change in your etcmodulesconf file to replace the default oss driver loading  httpwwwalsaprojectorgalsadoc very complete and very good documentation hopefully youll see that your card is supported  reboot  or remove by hand your current sound modules youll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource by hand and insert the new ones if all is well youve got alsa working dmesg to check is a good idea  you now just need to adjust the volume levels with eg aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default with aplay you can already test files to see if you hear anything you can also install the xmms plugin seems to make my xmms segfault on exit hmmm  but maybe its another plugin to listen to your good ol mp3 files thats it it really isnt complicated  and has never been from what i see the only thing i disliked was to have to install from source but as i cant imagine myself doing that  ive repackaged everything cleanly even the dev entries are included in the rpm package and not created by an ugly post script  i insist and seamlessly integrate into the etcmakedevd structure there are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided alsa spec files  for example ive split alsalibs development files into an alsalibdevel package and included static libraries there are others of course oh yes  the kernel version against which the alsadriver package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release  so does the architecture im open to any comments or suggestions about these packages download  httpftpfreshrpmsnetpubfreshrpmstestingalsa current spec files  httpfreshrpmsnetbuildsalsadriveralsadriverspec httpfreshrpmsnetbuildsalsalibalsalibspec httpfreshrpmsnetbuildsalsautilsalsautilsspec all others  patches etc  httpfreshrpmsnetbuilds  matthias ps as an extra bonus  ive also recompiled xine with alsa support simply run xine a alsa09 and off you go it may even support 51 and spdif   clean custom red hat linux rpm packages  httpfreshrpmsnet red hat linux release 73 valhalla running linux kernel 241810 load  057 042 042  ac online  battery charging 29 155  rpmlist mailing list rpmlistfreshrpmsnet httplistsfreshrpmsnetmailmanlistinforpmlist

1184,0,     your mail  and gives you only the nonspam  to train it  youd only need     to send it the false negatives somehow it can assume that anything is     ham that you dont say is spam within 48 hours   i have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day   constantly polling for mail if they go away for a long weekend   lots of friday night spam will become ham on sunday night  friday night seems to be the most popular time so well make this a config parameter    your idea here   ultimately id like to see tight integration into the most popular  email clients as a stopgap to the autoham  whats an autoham  how about adding an imap server with a spam and deletedham  folder most email clients can handle imap users should be able to  quickly move spam into the spam folder i personally dont think imap has a bright future  but for people who do use it  thats certainly a good approach  instead of deleting messages or  by reprogramming the delete  function they can quickly move ham into the ham folder yes guido van rossum home page httpwwwpythonorgguido

1186,0, thank you lars for your reply to my query  sa doesnt do any of these it is probably a function of whatever scanning systemmda  youre using amavis  procmail  whatever what exactly are you using i am using spamassassin as part of the mailscanner package using sendmail as the mta it integrates nicely in there  and shares a configuration file with sa all very neat  sa in itself does nothing really you need a frontend procmail  amavis  etc  at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message  to sa and do whatever other processing you want i thought that sa rated a message with a certain score  then did a certain action such as store  deliver  delete based on the configuration given i was hoping there were some other actions that i could customprogram in again  many thanks  adrian  this sfnet email is sponsored by osdn  tired of that same old cell phone  get a new here for free httpswwwinphoniccomrasprsourceforge1refcode1vs3390  spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet httpslistssourceforgenetlistslistinfospamassassintalk

1191,0, spamassassin is hurting democracy owen  httpwwwbayareacommldmercurynewsnewsopinion3900215htm internet can level the political playing field by mike mccurry and larry purpuro not many months from now  people across the country will experience one of the great recurring features of american democracy at shopping malls  on factory floors  at church socials and even on our front stoops  we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office while chances are high that we wont know them personally  they will walk up to us  offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes just as technology is affecting every other area of communication  it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters in this years gop gubernatorial primary  california secretary of state bill jones  who faced betterfunded candidates  acquired the email addresses of more than a million potential california voters and sent each an unsolicited email asking for support that day  he might have chosen any of the more traditional  and more expensive  methods of contacting voters  such as direct mail  radio spots or tv ads but he spent only about 2 cents per message  instead of 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium had jones chosen direct mail  radio or tv  that communication would have been equally unsolicited  as defined in the email world few voters would have opted in to receive campaign information from jones through any of those channels the response to jones email effort  however  was swift and intense he was lambasted by antispam advocates  and media coverage was almost entirely negative to be fair  some of jones tactics could have been refined he used a lessthanperfect list and no standardpractice paid for disclaimer in the message his detractors  however  attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the email was sent unsolicited in fact  jones online campaign may have been his most visible asset in an era of cynicism toward money in politics  money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums  jones tried to level the playing field no one likes commercial spam it is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive but as a sophisticated society  its time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited email sent by political candidates to voters the debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam we believe email is no more intrusive than direct mail  telemarketing or tv advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters a simple link in good email campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list  and viewers must repeatedly endure tv ads when a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest  he or she can use the internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes with more than 60 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing email accounts  it makes sense that political candidates use this medium candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of email lists and target content to specific recipient groups but the broader point remains when a political candidate sends a voter an email  that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it  unsubscribe from the list  read it or even reply and engage the sender that choice should belong to the voter  not to antispam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial email political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can  and let voters decide what to do with that information  mike mccurry  former press secretary for president clinton  is ceo of an advocacy management and communications software company larry purpuro  the former republican national committee deputy chief of staff  is founder and president of a political emarketing firm this was written for the los angeles times httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork

1200,0, url httpwwwjoelonsoftwarecomnews20020912html date not supplied were trying to decide if fogbugz1 30 should support custom fields historically  i am opposed to custom fields in principle  because they get abused people add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to harvard end result people dont enter bugs  which is much  much worse than not capturing all that information you can always page fault to get the information if the original report forgot it rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every dll on your machine this is an actual customer request  information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs  why not just have the programmerassignee look at the bug first  and if they think it might be dllversionrelated  only then bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the dll info similarly  its always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occurred this sounds logical  but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place only a small percentage of bugs are really os dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant but then how do you search for  say  all bugs which only happen on windows 98se aha you cant ever even with the custom field because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system  so this search doesnt make sense in the first place the info wasnt captured do a full text search for 98se and youll find some of them life is imperfect life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information  a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in ram on the computer in question and while youre at it  a photograph of the testers workspace but the goal of a bug tracking database is to keep track of bugs  which  all else being equal  takes priority over making it easy to find them i have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so highceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system  because they didnt know what all those fields were the real bugtracking happened in email  postits  and hallway conversations great a pretty common question we get on the customer service line is  does fogbugz support custom fields rather than giving our usual answer no on purpose over the last few weeks ive been saying  can you please tell me what fields you would need were trying to decide whether to implement that feature in 30 and we want to know why people need it the interesting thing is  almost all of the fields people ask for are already in fogbugz  and the other ones  in my educated opinion  shouldnt be fields and in fact  our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields one of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company  and i myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design  but i didnt  and they never needed it even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields  and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses but the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product gosh  even filemaker has custom fields righto its true and who am i to tell my customers they are wrong one person who i was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a builtin field for this would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved but its still rude of me to tell customers that we dont have that feature for their own good  even though it usually is  and were losing some sales because of it sigh i guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people dont use it at least we wont lose any sales  1 httpwwwfogcreekcomfogbugz

1208,0, hi all  i have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction i am involved in porting a sco unix application to linux  and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores  are being handled the application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all io be it screen  or file io  syncronisation is handled via semaphores in certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state  i have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop system call i have also noticed that if i introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away  but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww  lol is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop to fail to pick up the change in state in a semaphore immediately setting semflg  ipcnowait and checking for errno  eagain and recalling semop if the semop call fails 1 also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet both the parent controlling process run as the same uid  and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions 0666 any pointers would be appreciated rgds  colin nevin  do you yahoo everything youll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music charts httpukmyyahoocom  irish linux users group iluglinuxie httpwwwlinuxiemailmanlistinfoilug for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

1214,0, tim  another area for potentially fruitful study  its clear that the  highestvalue indicators usually appear early in msgs  and for spam  theres an actual reason for that  advertising has to strive  to get your attention early  so  for example  if we only bothered to  tokenize the first 90 of a msg  would results get worse neil schemenauer  spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning  of the message  in pratice that would probably work fine note that timtestpys current tokenizer only looks at decoded text mime sections or raw message text if no mime exists spammers could put megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldnt even be looked at except that the email package has to parse nontext parts well enough to skip over them  and tokens for the most interesting parts of contenttype  disposition  transferencoding decorations are generated for all mime sections schemes that remain ignorant of mime are vulnerable to spammers putting arbitrary amounts of nice text in the preamble area after the headers and before the first mime section  which most mail readers dont display  but which appear first in the file so are latched on to by grahams scoring scheme but i dont worry about clever spammers  ive seen no evidence that they exist 05 wink  even if they do  the open source zoo is such that no particular scheme will gain dominance  and theres no percentage for spammers in trying to fool just one scheme  even if they did  for the kind of scheme were using here they cant know what nice text is  not unless they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their messages to each different one  at that point theyd be doing targeted marketing  and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously ifyoureouttomakeaquickbuckyoudontwasteasecondonhard targetsly yrs   tim

1238,0, i wanted to get back to this but didnt have the time  i actually lived on a couple different indian reservations growing up in the pacific northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakotasioux country as well  and my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of indian reservations than i have my experience being a direct result of living with my parents  i do get a lot of my information firsthand  or in some cases  secondhand from my father the income figures for the indians are somewhat misleading  mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income  while it is true that some indians live in genuine poverty  it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe  not something that was impressed upon them the primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals  typically an indian corporation of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe  in most tribes  a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation  usually to the tune of 1030k per person  depending on the tribe  the dividend money comes from a number of places  with the primary sources being the federal govt and various businessesassets owned by the indian corporation you have to understand a couple things  first  a great many indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises  everyone gets a check for their share no matter what  one of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment often 7090 for tribal members  who are more than happy take their dividend and not work  the dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole income for government accounting purposes  unfortunately  to support this type of economics when no one works  theyve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends  many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works  one of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn  many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk  not indians second  even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend  they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually  by benefits and perks  we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary american receives from either their employer or the government it should be pointed out that while many of these indian corporations are ineptly run  and mostly provide sinecures for other indians  a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire nonindian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions  an example of this is the haida corporation  which while having less 1 000 tribal shareholders  has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the 200300 million range and growing  yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled  about 20k in this particular case  and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use  they dont eat their seed corn  and have actually managed to grow their stash  in contrast  a couple islands over  there is another tribe of 2 000 people that has a net loss of about 50 million annually iirc while being regularly endowed by the federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets  this particular tribe has a modest income in theory  but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars  and many borrow money against future income  incidentally  in this particular case  the people that are working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year  much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets somewhat annoying  the federal government semiregularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when theyve burned through the ones previously given where feasible  typically selling the assets to american or foreign companies  and the cycle continues so what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems  in a nutshell  a thoroughly pathological culture and society few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant  incest  rape  and gross promiscuity is rampant  inbreeding  heavy drug abuse during pregnancy  and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded  many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity  mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above  on one reservation my parents lived  the hiv infection rate was 70  many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt  and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious they do have their own judges  courts  police etc in short  many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere  because of their legal status  there really arent that many consequences for their behavior  there are many things that i could tell you that ive seen that you probably would not believe unless youd seen it yourself  there are always good people in these tribes  but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times  and this is a mobocracy typically  btw  if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs  try living on one of these messed up indian reservations  it will give you an interesting perspective on things there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians  the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely  the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part  even if they maintain their tribal identity  in both of these cases  the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above the indians are often quite wealthy technically  and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita  and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole  it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income  the poverty is social and cultural in nature  not economic  this was my original point on a tangent one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasitribal corporate socialism  many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mindbogglingly bad in execution  that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything  but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run  it is like a family corporation writ large it seems that in a future where familial ties will be increasingly voluntary  the general concept may have some merit in general western society  serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics  but with an arbitrary set of selfselecting individuals damn that was long and its late  and it could have been a lot longer james rogers jamesrbestcom on 92202 353 pm  john hall johnhallevergonet wrote   as i understand it  there is a huge difference between native americans  who speak english at

1270,0, jeremy hylton  i think one step towards deployment is creating a reusable tokenizer  for mail messages  the current codebase doesnt expose an easytouse  or easytocustomize tokenizer tokenize couldnt be easier to use  it takes a string argument  and produces a stream of tokens whether via explicit list  or generator  or tuple  or  doesnt matter  all the tokenize functions in gbayespy and timtestpy are freely interchangeable this way note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would do any good  or  if it would  in which ways customization could be helpful thats a research issue on which no work has been done  the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical  knowledge about how to parse mail messages  but the module wasnt  designed for reuse thats partly a failure of imagination wink  splitting out all knowledge of tokenization is just a large block cutandpaste  there  its done change the from timtoken import tokenize at the top to use any other tokenizer now  if you want to make it easier still  feel free to check in something better  id like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of  messages and tokenize each one the msg and msgstream classes in timtestpy are a start at that  but its hard to do anything truly useful here when people use all sorts of different physical representations for email msgs mboxes in various formats  one file per folder  one file per msg  skips gzipped gimmick    if youre a python coder wink  you should find it very easy to change the guts of msg and msgstream to handle your peculiar scheme defining interfaces for these guys should be done  id like to see the tokenize by customizable  too  tim had to exclude  some headers from his test data  because there were particular biases  in the test data  if other people have test data without those  biases  they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include  them or exclude others this sounds like a bottomless pit to me  and theres no easier way to customize than to edit the code  as readmetxt still says  though  massive refactoring would help  hop to it

1293,0, httponlinewsjcomarticleprint0  sb10327475102363433 00html the wall street journal september 23  2002 commentary rebuild at ground zero by larry silverstein earlier this month  we new yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on sept 11  2001 all of those who perished must never be forgotten the footprints of the fallen twin towers and a portion of the 16acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims families and  indeed  for all of us but for the good of the city and the region  the 10millionplus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the twin towers must be replaced on the site about 50 000 people worked in the world trade center those jobs are lost  along with those of another 50 000 people who worked in the vicinity together  those jobs in lower manhattan  for which the trade center was the economic stimulus  produced annual gross wages of about 47 billion  or 15 of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region  but many have not new york city is facing a budget deficit without additional jobs  the deficit may become permanent this is one reason for the importance of rebuilding if we do not replace the lost space  lower manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the worlds financial center love them or hate them  and there were lots of new yorkers on both sides of the issue  the towers made a powerful statement to the world that said  this is new york  a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life that is why they were destroyed this is a second reason why the towers must be replaced  and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement in recent weeks  redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources most of these focus not on the trade center site  however  but on all of lower manhattan further  many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere  scattered in several sites  or simply never rebuilt these proposals miss the point what was destroyed  and what must be recovered  was the trade center  not all of lower manhattan except over the towers footprints  where there must be no commercial development  the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size that was a major reason why the twin towers were leased to 97 occupancy before 911 none of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access with the reconstruction of the subway and path stations  plus an additional 45 billion in transit improvements planned  such as the new fulton transit center and the direct traintotheplane long island rail road connection  the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development and new york will need the space before 911  the group of 35  a task force of civic leaders led by sen charles schumer and former treasury secretary robert rubin  concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300 000 new jobs the loss of the twin towers only heightens the need as for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market  i would simply point out that history shows them wrong new york now has about 400 million square feet of office space all new construction underway already is substantially leased up new york had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990 by 1998  this space had been absorbed  at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet we are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the trade center site over a period of about 10 years  with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012 this is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet  much lower than the 1990s rate those who argue that new york cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline i will not accept this view  nor will most new yorkers mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york times that the city has to do two things memorialize  but also build for the future i believe that the twin towers site can gracefully accommodate  and that downtown requires  office and retail space of architectural significance  a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened  and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area the challenge to accomplish this is enormous but our city is up to the task mr silverstein is

1304,0, this article from nytimescom has been sent to you by kharealumnicaltechedu sure does explain fork  not yet abandoned  rohit kharealumnicaltechedu some friends  indeed  do more harm than good september 10  2002 by mary duenwald  friends are supposed to be good for you in recent years  scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress  they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless they are even less susceptible to the common cold  studies show but not all friends have such a salutary effect some lie  insult and betray some are overly needy some give too much advice psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends friendship is often very painful  said dr harriet lerner  a psychologist and the author of the dance of connection in a close  enduring friendship  jealousy  envy  anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads one has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and im disbanding it another book  when friendship hurts  by dr jan yager  a sociologist at the university of connecticut at stamford  advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside theres this myth that friendships should last a lifetime  dr yager said but sometimes its better that they end that social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable  considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all marriage and family relationships  between siblings or parents and children  have been seen as more important of course  troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are and children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad as a popular author of relationship advice books  dr lerner said  never once have i had anyone write and say my best friend hits me dr beverley fehr  a professor of psychology at the university of winnipeg  noted that sociological changes  like a 50 percent divorce rate  have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health now that a marital relationship cant be counted on for stability the way it was in the past  and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members  people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy  said dr fehr  the author of friendship processes until the past couple of years  the research on friendship focused on its health benefits now were starting to look at it as a more full relationship  said dr suzanna rose  a professor of psychology at florida international university in miami like marriage  friendship also has negative characteristics the research is in its infancy psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship  dr fehr said so far they have only  through surveys and interviews  figured out that it is a significant problem the early research  dr fehr added  is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought how can a friend be bad most obviously  dr rose said  by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise illadvised pursuit when you think of people who were friends at enron  she added  you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior betrayal also makes for a bad friendship when friends split up  said dr keith e davis  a professor of psychology at the university of south carolina  it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential another form of betrayal  dr yager said  is when a friend suddenly turns cold  without ever explaining why its more than just pulling away  she said the silent treatment is actually malicious at least as devastating is an affair with the friends romantic partner  as recently happened to one of dr lerners patients i would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out  dr lerner said a third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person  dr yager said one of the 180 people who responded to dr yagers most recent survey on friendship described how  when she was 11  her best friend called her a derogatory name the woman  now 32  was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since  dr yager said emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse  but it is more insidious  dr yager said some people constantly set up their friends  she explained theyll have a party  not invite the friend  but make sure he or she finds out risk takers  betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends  dr yager said  but they are not the only ones she identifies 21 different varieties occupying the second tier of badness are the liar  the person who is overly dependent  the friend who never listens  the person who meddles too much in a friends life  the competitor and the loner  who prefers not to spend time with friends most common is the promise breaker this includes everyone from the person who says lets have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them  but then isnt  dr yager said some friendships go bad  as some romantic relationships do  when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one with couples  it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover theres something important they dont like about the other person  said dr rose of florida international one might find  for example  that in subtle ways the other person is a racist in friendships  which are less intense  it may take even more time for one person to meet the others dislike criteria whether a friendship is worth saving  dr lerner said  depends on how large the injury is sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go  she added its also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another persons limitations acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses  dr lerner said  because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one but if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress  the healthy response is to pull away  dr yager said  to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life  and start being too busy to get together  ever it takes two people to start and maintain a friendship  but only one to end it  dr yager said friendship  because it is voluntary and unregulated  is far easier to dissolve than marriage but it is also comparatively fragile  experts say ideally  the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones  dr lerner said it is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while youre healthy and your life and work are going well  she said because when a crisis hits  when someone you love dies  or you lose your job and your health insurance  when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability  you will discover how crucial and lifepreserving good friendship is httpwwwnytimescom20020910healthpsychology10friehtmlex1032684795ei1en2a88a6d1b985c977 how to advertise  for information on advertising in email newsletters or other creative

1306,0, r a hettinga wrote begin pgp signed message hash sha1  at 1115 am 0400 on 92202  geege schuman wrote     most of them seem to have ivy league educations  or are ivy league dropouts suggesting to me that they werent exactly poor to start with    actually  if i remember correctly from discussion of the lists composition in forbes about five or six years ago  the best way to get on the forbes 400 is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps  boys and girls i knew you could   sure  discussion in forbes  rigorous research  that especially when the data in their own list contradicts them i continue to look at the list and all the inherited  growed entries i guess if i read it enough times my vision will clear given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school  like  say  mine    is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a governmentrun high school  youll probably get more of those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing transferpayment depression an economic version of this summers governmentforest conflagration  caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this summer  that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out there  including me    to learn to actually feed themselves   the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a terminal professional degree  like an mba  phd  md  etc  from the best school possible  why because  as of about 1950  the best way to get into harvard  for instance  is to be smart  not rich dont take my word for it  ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof   i  at on point  looked into stanford business school after learning that tuition was  20k  no financial aid was available  and parttime work was disallowed  this smart person decided that i was not willing to spend the 150 application fee nonrefundable during attendance at my local business school  i was told repeatedly i should have gone for it  to quote a prof  northwestern mba  it has nothing to do with the education you receive  in general european and canadian business schools are better and more innovative  its the connections he used the words american nobility meritocracy  american style  was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint    and  of course  chicago taught them all how  right  practically nobody who goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless  of course  their parents  who couldnt afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so and their kids still had to get the grades  and biased by intelligence   test scores  to get in   invented being the right word dubya went to yale and hbs i guess practically gets you around that problem  the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees  until they actually own something and hire people  or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people who dont work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone is smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow  btw  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that im using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri  and i dont have a degree in anything actually useful  much less a terminal one  which means im broker than anyone on this list  its just that you  of all people  lots with educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and economics is not a zerosum game the cost of anything  including ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case  intelligence and effort  i will  however  admit to being educated waay past my level of competence  and  by the way you discuss economics  so have you  apparently    its interesting but in this part of the world nova scotia a recent study found that college graduates earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges trade schools they did decline to mention that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in just for the record  the average salary for a university graduate including advanced degree holders here is c 21 000    14 000 us no wonder half of san francisco has set up here  we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years  i think they hire some entry level it people for around 10 6 us an hour  which of course  fits perfectly for me  my entry level job  in 1986  paid 1100 an hour the fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are unionizedin other words  in this part of the world  for the vast majority of people  union dues are a better investment than tuition the counterargument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere  but the countercounter argument is that we are the thin edge one of several really  prison labor in the us would be another of thirdworld wages and work practices coming to north america i worked at a company that had a 14year wage freeze the fact that they could maintain that and prosper just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world i met many people there  like me  who felt that was fine  i can vote with my feet they didnt quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar  or worse  policies anyway eventually they started a union drive during the vote  retired employees were brought in by the employer rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here  a bottle of rum and somehow allowed to vote  the union filed a grievance  which was denied  by a minister of labour  who  hey  guess what  used to be a vp at the company thats free labor markets at work the business continues to prosper  as i was told when i was there   it is a cash cow as long as the joa joint operating agreement with the competing paper is in place and if you think that any of those wonderful american companies  out of some freeenterprise belief in competing for the best talent  are going to do anything about that  sorry  most of them received generous subsidies  in return  im sure  for an understanding about the labor markets here  btw  if we ever actually had free markets in this country  including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes  all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money  and there would be more selfmade people on that list in addition  most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it  not even relatively speaking finally  practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else  investment bubbles or not  that efficiency is called progress  for those of you in the peoples republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff  cheaper  over time  a terrible  petitbourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite  or youd know about it by now in economic terms  its also called an increase in general welfare  and  no  virginia  im not talking about extorting money from someone who works  and giving it to someone who doesnt in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time   much as i like to accept what you say  i do believe in free markets   i have difficulty finding any  except of course for labor markets  which governments go to great lengths to protect well unless the supply is tight it was a great run with the technology industry  producing most of the selfmade billionaires on the list  but now weve got a governmentsponsored monopoly  and the concept of more stuff  cheaper which it has always promised  seems to be disappearing a particularly galling example is highspeed internet access an article i read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry cheaper  better or you die and the telecom industry maintain your monopoly through regulation  and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators meet sadly to say  the telecom industry seems to have won the whole entertainment industryriaapalladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few  in short  then  economics is not a zero sum game  property is not theft  the rich dont get rich off the backs of the poor  and redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit  happy or otherwise  to believe otherwise  is  quite literally  given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense   i usually agree  but when theres a republican in office   i feel like theyre the biggest believers in the manifesto  in reverse create a reserve pool of labor  reduce the rights of that proletariat youve just created with bogus law and order policies   concentrate capital in the hands of a few ideally people who can get you reelected and the economy will take care of itself oh  and lie  use the word compassionate a lot i guess i tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state  the basic economic tenet of the republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass  the more efficient the rest of us will be and the facts are  for most people in the western world  are declining standards of living  declining benefits  disappearing social safety net  greater working hours   essentially since the entrance of women into the work force not blaming women in any way  they have a right to work but its now 2 wageearners in each family and still declining standards of living is the reality again to quote that wonderfully liberal document i keep coming back to  the cia world factbook  on the us economy since 1975  practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20 of households

1430,0, politicians worldwide are discovering the internet  what a great tool for fascism  once you got the laws in place to solve that whole anonymity thing also i notice this story shows the truth  the canadian government is really located in washington  dc  ottawa is just a branch office come to think of it  the last story i posted about canada featured the head of its military  speaking to us from military hq  in palm beach  florida owen   will canadas isps become spies by declan mccullagh mailtodeclanmccullaghcnetcom staff writer  cnet newscom august 27  2002  1256 pm pt httpnewscomcom21001023955595html httpnewscomcom21001023955595htmltagprntfr washingtonthe canadian government is considering a proposal that would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies a discussion draft httpwwwcanadajusticegccaenconslaal released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every canadian with an internet account  a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online the canadian government  including the department of justice httpcanadajusticegcca and industry canada httpwwwicgcca  wrote the 21page blueprint as a nearfinal step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in early 2003 arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form  canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even runofthemill crimes they also claim that by enacting these proposals  canada will be following its obligations under the council of europes cybercrime treaty httpnewscomcom21001001268894html  which the country is in the process of considering if the discussion draft were to become law  it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses  authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months  and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in most circumstances  a court order would be required for government agents to conduct internet monitoring canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of europe  and representatives from both countries police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty httpconventionscoeinttreatyencadrelistetraiteshtm  which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly 50 participating nations  only albania has formally adopted httpconventionscoeinttreatyensearchsigaspnt185cm8df270802  or ratified  the treaty michael geist httpaix1uottawaca7egeist  a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in ecommerce law  says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification theyve given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes  geist said to me thats not a particularly convincing argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority  make that case geist added that theres nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i dont know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and dataretention orders the united states has a similar requirement  called the communications assistance for law enforcement act httpwwwepicorgprivacywiretapcaleacalealawhtml  but it applies only to preinternet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless  wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies  according to the proposal companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment sarah andrews  an analyst at the electronic privacy information center httpwwwepicorg epic who specializes in international law  says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers  not just internet providers  andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes httpwwwprivacyinternationalorgissuescybercrimecoengoletter601htm the cybercrime treaty  saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about all canadian internet users the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information  the draft says gus hosein  a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international  calls the database a dumb idea immediately you have to wonder if youre allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether youre allowed to connect to the internet anonymously  hosein said a representative for george radwanski httpwwwprivcomgccaaueasp  canadas privacy commissioner  said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not have any comments on the paper as it stands comments on the proposal can be sent to laaljusticegcca mailtolaaljusticegcca no later than nov 15

1500,0,   well  i dont really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package   built against something that wasnt installed through rpm    following that reasoning  ive been installing all my custombuilt  kernels through rpm recently i find it annoying  though  that  alsakernel  and similar packages  will only build for the currently  running kernel   so ive attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the  targetkernel environment variable before running rpmbuild you  still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed  but at  least it doesnt have to be currently running its kinda hackish  so  if someone has a better way to do this  let me know  that idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more what you sent doesnt support packages named kernelsmp id also prefer a cleaner way than the env variable  and preferrably not editing the spec probably define target 24xxxx with smp sound good enough the buildrequires on kernelsource will also need to be removed because it wont necessarily need to be true  and that does bug me a bit  me and my kernel rpm builds  this all works along the same idea i have been aiming for  but the freaking redhat kernel srpms still have been stump  if we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working  it would be whole lot easier to try out a newer kernel  but then the size of these rpms are huge  at least for us n1 world courties    i will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working idea  thanks guys mailed lee  rpmlist mailing list rpmlistfreshrpmsnet httplistsfreshrpmsnetmailmanlistinforpmlist

1506,0, httpmediaguardiancoukbroadcastcomment0 7493 781769 00html hamzas horrid  but we must tolerate him rod liddle wednesday august 28  2002 the guardian sheikh abu hamza almasri  our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies  spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park  hackney ive often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays head for the beach and maybe swing by bq on the way home  i had hoped i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea  an icecream cone in his one good hand  the waves tickling his shins  and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once  instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you  too but bq and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamzas budget since the bank of england froze his assets  so victoria park had to do but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him  with the babble of tiny  cheerful  islamic protowarriors in the background you must know hamza hes the imam designed  it would seem  by the daily mails cartoonist mac large metal hook in place of a left hand one eye covered by a patch  the other a baleful  watchful  milkywhite we dont mock the disabled any more these days  unless its someone like hamza whom we dont like then  if youll excuse the inapt phraseology  the gloves come off so hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right as captain hook  in articles which usually call for his arrest  or extradition to the us  or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan  where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities  anywhere  really just out of here and if we cant lock him up or chuck him out of the country  maybe we can force him to shut up because we dont like hamza very much we werent that fond of him before september 11  but afterwards  in that nervy  paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in  our disapprobation turned into political persecution and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because theyve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner  urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam all out of context  and a very long time ago  says the imam  not unduly bothered but perhaps he should be  because our reputation for broadmindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirrors scoop hamza preaches  or preached  at the scary finsbury park mosque  so  earlier this year  the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks i didnt know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that he has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen he is tailed by the police every now and then  and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press and this last point is because  we tell ourselves  endlessly  repeating the mantra over and over again  and fervently wishing it to be true  hamza is not representative of british muslims  as if british muslims were a simple  homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation and perhaps succour the trouble is  in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more representative than the list of those governmentapproved muslim spokesmen who were  uncomfortably  i suspect  dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban an opinion poll commissioned by radio 4s today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bushs crusade one in six were  to put it mildly  ambivalent about the attack on the us the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam which is what hamza said  repeatedly but it was something that  at the time  we didnt want to hear now  if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across  superficially  at least  as someone from the liberal left no war against iraq britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger action against israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth nor is he particularly antisemitic  so far as i can tell  although i dont suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year in yesterdays guardian  the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikhs message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is  without question  rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would be happy  in a truly islamic society  to stone women to death for adultery  for example you and i would find many  perhaps most  of his views utterly repellent and thats the point because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural multiculturalism is not  surely  the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism multiculturalism is  rather  the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture  and maybe learn from them the fbi has been investigating hamza  but  of course  has found nothing remotely incriminating the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally this is a perfectly noble argument  but it does not wash you dont defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesnt exist and if british muslims  maybe a minority  maybe not  feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy  it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza shutting the man up  therefore  wont make a difference it is rather as louis macneice had it the glass is falling hour by hour  the glass will fall for ever but if you break the bloody glass  you wont hold up the

1566,0, i think one step towards deployment is creating a reusable tokenizer for mail messages  the current codebase doesnt expose an easytouse or easytocustomize tokenizer the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical knowledge about how to parse mail messages  but the module wasnt designed for reuse  id like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one id like to see the tokenize by customizable  too  tim had to exclude some headers from his test data  because there were particular biases in the test data  if other people have test data without those biases  they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include them or exclude others jeremy

1572,0, followups to spambayespythonorg please  unless youre specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for pythonorg ok  after much fiddling with and tweaking of etceximexim4conf and etceximlocalscanpy on mailpythonorg  i am fairly confident that i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moments notice  for the record  heres how it all works  exim4conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file etceximharvest does not exist  that is  any junk mail condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists is handled entirely in exim4conf the message is rejected before it ever gets to localscanpy  this covers such diverse cases as message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command  no messageid header  and 8bit chars in subject both rejected after the message headersbody are read the main things i have changed in the absence of etceximharvest are  dont check for 8bit chars in from header  the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin  do header sender verification ie ensure that theres a verifiable email address in at least one of from  replyto  and sender as late as possible  because it requires dns lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred  if those dns lookups timeout  if etceximharvest exists  then the behaviour of all of those acls in exim4conf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients or messages  they add an xreject header to the message  this header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved  and also gives the smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message thus  those messages will now be seen by localscanpy  which now looks for the xreject header  if found  it uses the folder name specified there to save the message  and then rejects it with the smtp error message also given in xreject  currently xreject is retained in saved messages if a message was not tagged with xreject  then localscanpy runs the usual virus and spam checks  namely  my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables  and a run through spamassassin  the logic is basically this if virus folder  virus else run through spamassassin if score  100 folder  rejectedspam elif score  50 folder  caughtspam finally  localscanpy writes the message to the designated folder by far the biggest folder will be accepted  the server handles 20005000 incoming messages per day  of which maybe 100500 are junk mail  oops  just realized i havent written the code that actually saves the message  dohh  also havent written anything to discriminate personal email  which i must do  sigh  finally  the big catch waiting until after youve read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic  because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers dont consider a 5xx after data as a permanent error  but keep retrying  dohh  this is a minor annoyance currently  where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time  but in harvest mode  everything with the exception of people probing for open relays will be rejected at data time  so i have cooked up something called the asbl  or automated sender blacklist  this is just a berkeley db file that maps senderip  senderaddress to an expiry time  when localscan rejects a message from senderip  senderaddress  for whatever reason  including finding an xreject header added by an acl in exim4conf  it adds a record to the asbl  with an expiry time 3 hours in the future  meanwhile  theres an acl in exim4conf that checks for records in the asbl if theres a record for the current senderip  senderaddress that hasnt expired yet  we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body the downside of this from the pointofview of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming pythonorg  one smtp connection per address  we will most likely only get one copy  this is a win if youre just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth  but im not sure if its helpful for training spam detectors  tim happy harvesting  greg  greg ward gwardpythonnet                         httpwwwgergca budgets in the red  lets tax religion  dead kennedys

1593,0, i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe 13 years ago there is at least one product that does it for pc though i dont recall its name it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem or some other image of a filesystem that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept or is not graceful readonly storage it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures  which are older still there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem the written information must obviously be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate it does not  of course  distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not if you truly know a device or perhaps a partition must not be written  it can be simpler to either return error on writes  or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments i have not tried it on extf3 or reiser btw  think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raid4 or raid5 i would contend that with cheaper storage these days  it makes little sense to use raid  save for shadowing and possibly striping those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have  and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write sometimes of raid glenn everhart original message from bmordiconnicholsoncom mailtobmordiconnicholsoncom sent tuesday  september 03  2002 304 pm to webappsec securityfocuscom secprog securityfocus subject use of base image  delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi  i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead  each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list httpwwwvmwarecomsupportreferencecommondisksharinghtml could this basic concept be used to easily make selffixing clientserver applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks  even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production clientserver systems are layered for example  your basic web application might have a web server running apache  connected to an application server running some j2ee or net business logic  connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server  and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for  say  swap space  but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system  they will probably change an image that shouldnt be changed eg  they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image  writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal  because it is only deleting data  rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability  this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this baseredo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid  allowing for greater performance  reliability  and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers  and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files  of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i dont yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post  but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardwareseparation of volatile and nonvolatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations  only it would be more efficient and involve less or no downtime thanks for any opinions  ben  this transmission may contain

1611,0,  what is mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions  it is the standard for how to send multipart  multimedia  and binary data using the worldwide internet email system  typical uses of mime include sending images  audio  wordprocessing documents  programs  or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file  mime also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient or mail program may determine what to do with them how can i read a mime message since mime is only a few years old  there are still some mailers in use which do not understand mime messages  however  there are a growing number of mail programs that have mime support builtin  one popular mimecapable mailer for unix  vms and pcs is pine  developed at the university of washington and available via anonymous ftp from the host ftpcacwashingtonedu in the file pinepinetarz in addition  several proprietary email systems provide mime translation capability in their internet gateway products  however  even if you do not have access to a mimecapable mailer or suitable gateway  there is still hope there are a number of standalone programs that can interpret a mime message  one of the more versatile is called munpack  it was developed at carnegie mellon university and is available via anonymous ftp from the host ftpandrewcmuedu in the directory pubmpack  there are versions available for unix  pc  mac and amiga systems  for compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files  the munpack program can also decode messages in splituuencoded format does mime replace uuencode yes  uuencode has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via internet mail  but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems  mime uses a more robust encoding called base64 which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways how can i learn more about mime the mime internet standard is described in rfc1521  available via anonymous ftp from many different internet hosts  including  o  us east coast address  dsinternicnet 198494510  o  us west coast address  ftpisiedu 1289032  o  pacific rim address  munnariozau 128250121  o  europe address  nicnordunet 1923614817 look for the file rfcrfc1521txt another source of information is the internet news group compmailmime  which includes a periodic posting of a frequently asked questions list  httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork

1618,0, well  it looks like sun are going ahead with their ubiquitous computing plans without mithril greg reuters market news sun micro outlines roadmap for managing networks friday september 20  500 am et by peter henderson san francisco reuters  computer maker sun microsystems inc on thursday said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as straightforward to handle as a single machine  a strategy it calls n1 it laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld unwieldy networks into easytouse systems  a goal similar to those of most rivals making computers which manage networks emc corp announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage resources as a pool hewlettpackard co has a utility data center  designed for broader management international business machines corps project eliza is working to make computers selfhealing when systems break applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the whole idea behind n1 is you stop thinking about that you dont think about what box it is running on  sun vice president steve mackay  head of the n1 program  said in an interview on the sidelines of a sun user conference many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or water  as a utility that can be turned on or off  in whatever volume one wants whenever needed for that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly  rather than cobbling them together with tenuous links  as most networks do today  experts say there are still major barriers  though  such as communications standards for machines from different vendors to interoperate closely sun promised to deliver a virtualization engine that would let administrators look at their entire network as a pool by the end of the year network administrators today often have no automatic system to report what is in the network itll tell you what you have and how it is laid out  promised mackay the second stage  beginning in 2003  would allow users to identify a service  such as online banking  and allocate resources for them with a few clicks  sun said finally  in 2004  suns software should allow networks to change uses of resources on the fly in response to changing needs  such as a bank assuring quicker online response time for priority users  the company said

1654,0, neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each were missing half his test run results due to a cmppy bug since fixed the before custom fiddling figures on the 3 reported runs were false positive percentages 0187 0749 0780 total unique fp 19 false negative percentages 2072 2448 0574 total unique fn 43 the total unique figures counts all 6 runs its just the individualrun fp and fn percentages were missing for 3 runs jeremy reported these before custom fiddling figures on 4 sets with about 600 ham and spam in each false positive percentages 0000 1398 1398 0000 1242 1242 1398 1398 0000 1553 1553 0000 total unique fp 139 false negative percentages 10413 6104 5027 8259 2873 5745 5206 4488 9336 5206 5027 9874 total unique fn 970 so things are clearly working much better for neil  both reported significant improvements in both fn and fp rates by folding in more header lines  neal added received analysis to the base tokenizers header analysis  and jeremy skipped the base tokenizers header analysis completely but added basesubjectlinelike but casefolded tokenization for almost all header lines excepting only received  data  xfrom  and  i suspect  all those starting with xvm when i try 5 random pairs of 500ham  500spam subsets in my test data  i see false positive percentages 0000 0000 0200 0000 0200 0000 0200 0000 0000 0200 0400 0000 0200 0000 0200 0400 0000 0400 0200 0600 total unique fp 10 false negative percentages 0800 0400 0200 0600 1000 0000 0600 1200 1200 0800 0400 0800 1800 0800 0400 1000 1000 0400 0000 0600 total unique fn 36 this is much closer to what neil saw  but still looks better  another run on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same total unique fp rose to 12 and fn fell to 27 on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random pairs  likewise  with fp 12 and fn 40  so im pretty confident that its not going to matter which random subsets of 500 i take from my data its hard to conclude anything given jeremys much worse results  if they were in line with neils results  id suspect that ive overtuned the algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora

monday  september 30  2002 1011 pm subject dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil  one of the most bizarre pages ive seen on the web at first i thought it  might be some sort of backstory to a rpg  but  nope  it looks like somebody  believes this     httpwwwvikingzorgr20ihtm   m09 dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil  dinosaurs reptoid ets are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on  their hind legs this is a description of a dinosaur it now appears in  remote viewing that the reptoid ets  dinosaurs and dragons are all linked  together and that they all originated on earth the erideans who are reptoid  derivatives have a home planet in the eridanus system like all other ets  the reptoids have no reported home planet they also come over as entities  with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit this is a  description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see  them thus it could be that the reptoids  erideans  nordics  anunnaki  but  not the greys  all have origins on earth and have a strong link to earth  even if they choose to live elsewhere the greys do not appear to have a  renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on earth  the definitive work on dragons is the flight of dragons by peter  dickinson if dragons did exist in the flesh  they did not survive the long  bow targets do not come much bigger   truth is stranger than fiction thus the writers current scenario is that  there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard  their eggs and young  and who probably preferred to live underground they  survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty  they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet  for them possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves  but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control   thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the  dinosaurs they must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also  to appear to some people they have appeared to the writer in remote  viewing they are living on as vampire entities such immortal minds are  contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers if they can be  encouraged to reincarnate  then the power sources of the black magicians and  mind controllers will disappear encouraging them to reincarnate will help  so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great  difficulty surviving reincarnation purging peoples dinosaurs should remove  all perverse psychic abilities not under their control they are a source of  satanic guardian angels and demons they control us by owning our psi thus  if we regain ownership of psi  we must relinquish their control and that of  all other mind controllers encourage people to regain ownership of their  psi   the origins of love  hate and pure malice the following scenario appears to  hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious   dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of  rotting vegetation a good source of beetles and grubs for young  hatchelings they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm  which made  them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change in order to  keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control to do this  they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators this is an  act of hatred and outward looking while a few dinosaurs did develop the  ability to bear living young  most did not the dinosaurs got in first and  so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds they have  become the source of all satans  devils and demons   birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep  them warm a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs say one per day and  only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid thus all eggs tend  to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth this is  primarily an act of love but inward looking bearing live young is not  suitable to a bird of the air a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far  antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm   even if they are standing on ice   mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act  of love and inward looking this is especially true as a mammalian female  can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird  sitting on a nest   dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young   while birds and mammals developed love birds and mammals certainly do hate  all enemies of their young  but this is secondary   if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician  then  purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs unfortunately most of our  religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control   regardless of the front they put out to the public religion tends to  concentrate on how to brainwash your neighbour conscious thought has  built many mighty empires  theologies and slave control systems out of using  how to care for and protect ones young as a foundation   thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something a load of  dinosaurs eggs

easy surveillance by police and spy agencies a discussion draft httpwwwcanadajusticegccaenconslaal released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every canadian with an internet account  a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online the canadian government  including the department of justice httpcanadajusticegcca and industry canada httpwwwicgcca  wrote the 21page blueprint as a nearfinal step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in early 2003 arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form  canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even runofthemill crimes they also claim that by enacting these proposals  canada will be following its obligations under the council of europes cybercrime treaty httpnewscomcom21001001268894html  which the country is in the process of considering if the discussion draft were to become law  it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses  authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months  and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in most circumstances  a court order would be required for government agents to conduct internet monitoring canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of europe  and representatives from both countries police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty httpconventionscoeinttreatyencadrelistetraiteshtm  which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly 50 participating nations  only albania has formally adopted httpconventionscoeinttreatyensearchsigaspnt185cm8df270802  or ratified  the treaty michael geist httpaix1uottawaca7egeist  a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in ecommerce law  says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification theyve given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes  geist said to me thats not a particularly convincing argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority  make that case geist added that theres nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i dont know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and dataretention orders the united states has a similar requirement  called the communications assistance for law enforcement act httpwwwepicorgprivacywiretapcaleacalealawhtml  but it applies only to preinternet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless  wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies  according to the proposal companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment sarah andrews  an analyst at the electronic privacy information center httpwwwepicorg epic who specializes in international law  says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers  not just internet providers  andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes httpwwwprivacyinternationalorgissuescybercrimecoengoletter601htm the cybercrime treaty  saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about all canadian internet users the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information  the draft says gus hosein  a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international  calls the database a dumb idea immediately you have to wonder if youre allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether youre allowed to connect to the internet anonymously  hosein said a representative for george radwanski httpwwwprivcomgccaaueasp  canadas privacy commissioner  said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not have any comments on the paper as it stands comments on the proposal can be sent to laaljusticegcca mailtolaaljusticegcca no later than nov 15

competitive advantage by integrating the advanced communications capabilities of the webex platform with endeavors secure p2p collaboration network  endeavors has created a new method of worldclass teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel with the rapid growth in popularity of web meetings  the rationale for this worldclass relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience between online meetings the issue by those preferring not to travel is how to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between meetings rather than depending on intermittent  insecure email and multiple copies of constantly changing documents intermeeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium  independent of time in asynchronous mode  a team member can access  read and edit information relevant to the meeting group at hisher convenience rather than having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others a secured environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also essential endeavors magi technology converts the web into a secure platform for sharing information directly from peoples desktops webex meetings can be recorded and reviewed at any time  documents shared in the meeting can be actioned in realtime or at a later date  calendars and project schedules can be updated at any time  and new individuals added to the workgroup at will  all in a secure environment with people working across the globe  inside or outside company firewalls magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to web meeting participants not only can they share and access information at will  but they can also know which other participants are online or present this enables them to chat and message each other  search across other peoples magi environment  and work jointly on relevant documents highly productively with magi collaboration  in tandem with webex conferencing  the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs  phone bills  and  most importantly  timely completion of projects and tasks in order to realise the full potential of web meetings  bestofbreed services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries  says bernard hulme  tadpoles group chief executive the powerful combination of endeavors magi and webexs communications technologies will assist global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by maintaining teamwork momentum within and between web meetings webex is

1780,0, robert harley it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly  precisely identical between males and females yeah  assuming approximately equal populations but that obscures the different modes of promiscuity both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous  in the broadest sense of the word but their motives and behavior are quite different langur monkeys were the example in the cited article dominant males  kill babies that are not their own the dominant male monkey  seeks to defend his harem of females but cozying up to the current dominant male isnt the best strategy for female langurs  because dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so by mating with as many extragroup males as possible  female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide  by the male who is likely next to rule the roost maybe its just me  but that doesnt paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings the dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to new orleans is a better picture of that   chat with friends online  try msn messenger httpmessengermsncom

1800,0, httpwwwtechcentralstationcom1051printerjspcid1051100802b the disappearing alliance by dale franks 10082002 for over two generations  the countries of western europe have been our closest allies we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism tragically  a generation from now  we may be bitter adversaries europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed progressive transnationalism the key doctrines of this form of postcommunist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas among these are the deconstruction of nationalism  the promotion of postnationalist ideas of citizenship ie a global citizenry  a redefinition of democracy  and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations the european union  itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations  is postdemocratic while there is a european parliament  the eus power resides mainly in the unelected european commission ec and its unelected president  who face few limits to their power instead of a limited  consensual form of government  where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws  the eu has an appointed  oligarchic executive  along with a large attendant bureaucracy  whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense moreover  the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eus political elite both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments this is a step backward in europes political development european criticism of america is on the rise  and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation they hate the fact that our citizens own guns they despise the fact that we execute murderers they resent the fact that our economy is so large  and that americans consume so much they also resentand fear  the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world on august 9  2002  adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uks independent newspaper  in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained  perhaps by a european military invasion  followed by a decade or so of occupation fortunately  the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us  but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic at least  for now despite the tongueincheek nature of this editorial  however  the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states because they have built such a system in europe  they feel its valid for the rest of the world america  however  is the biggest obstacle to such a system the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited  consensual  and constitutional government  than it does on compliance with international norms they view all departures from such norms as aberrant because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms  they assume that  since the process is ostensibly legitimate  the results must be as well the trouble with this idea  of course  is that it gives the views of nondemocratic  authoritarian states the same weight as those of free  democratic societies it sanctifies the process  with no regard to the actual results thus  they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens  and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power our repeated references to the us constitution  and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms  are incomprehensible to them they assume  therefore  that our refusal is based on arrogance  rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights none of this bodes well for the future of euroamerican friendship  or cooperation if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism  their criticism of the us will rise  while their tolerance of our differences will fall obviously  in such a political atmosphere  the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase that thought is frightening enough even more frightening  however  is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism   r a hettinga mailto rahibuccom the internet bearer underwriting corporation httpwwwibuccom 44 farquhar street  boston  ma 02131 usa  however it may

turn was mentioned in a pogues track  billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of stoneybatter and grangegorman where i now live during the 18th century  who discovered a new  but not entirely legal  way to make money blogend linktext billy in the bowl from         daev hellshawfringewarecom subject      the case of the stoneybatter strangler a story of my new neighbourhood the irish digest july 1964 the case of the stoneybatter strangler the handsome  deformed billy in the bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors then  one night  he made the biggest mistake of his life dublin in the eighteenth century was noted for two things  the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes  many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin  but there was one who campaigned among the working class  this was billy in the bowl the strange appellation was derived from the fact that billys sole means of transport was a large bowlshaped car with wheels  seated in this  bowl   the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs  one in each hand billys unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary  as he had been born without legs  nature  however  had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and  what was most important  an unusually handsome face this was billys greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passersby from their small change the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter  until a servant girl or an old lady would come along he would then put on is most attractive smile which  together with his black curly hair  never failed to halt the females  the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity billy in the bowl  however  wasnt satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money  the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices  gambling and drinking as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk  was falling  the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street  on dublins north quays when billy heard the womans footsteps  he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane  as his unsuspecting victim drew close  the beggar moaned and shouted  and cried out for help trembling with excitement  the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed  she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch  when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes in a few minutes it was all over  the woman lay in a dead faint  and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his  bowl   his victirns purse snug in his coat pocket  an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition  but failed to give a description of her assailant  and  as billy in the bowl had figured  nobody would suspect a deformed beggar again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan  always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or  stoneybatter on one occasion  billy in the bowl  tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her  the incident became known as the 11 grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir hundreds flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months billy in the bowl was forced to desert his usual haunts  around this period  dublins firstever police force was been mobilised  and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder months passed and  billy in the bowl reverted once again to his old pasttime  a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed  and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district  but the beggar still rolled along in his bowl pitied and unsuspected  then came the night that finished billys career of crime two stoudy built female cooks  trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city  were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help  rushing over  they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch billy  thinking there was only one woman  grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch  she proved much too strong for him  however and while resisting tore at his face with her sharp fingernails meanwhile  her companion acted with speed and daring  pulling out her large hatpin she made for the beggar  and plunged the pin into his right eye the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene  among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy billy in the bowl was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence  but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl  the grangegormanstoneybatter district became once again a quiet  attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled  and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night daev  rev  dave daev walsh

1849,0, hi  i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead  each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list httpwwwvmwarecomsupportreferencecommondisksharinghtml could this basic concept be used to easily make selffixing clientserver applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks  even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production clientserver systems are layered for example  your basic web application might have a web server running apache  connected to an application server running some j2ee or net business logic  connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server  and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for  say  swap space  but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system  they will probably change an image that shouldnt be changed eg  they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image  writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal  because it is only deleting data  rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability  this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this baseredo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid  allowing for greater performance  reliability  and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers  and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files  of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i dont yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post  but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardwareseparation of volatile and nonvolatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations  only it would be more efficient and involve less or no downtime thanks for any opinions  ben

1863,0, 2 things  first  the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 84  bytecode compilation was added  and it is slightly more strict in its parsing than the original parser  you can only have a comment where tcl would expect to find a command  switch has a pattern  body strucutre  so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find a pattern  both of you will be confused with the results  the subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines i cant give you the exact case  but i know exmh had one example that stopped parsing correctly  and was arguably wrong before 2nd  ive managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the pgp support in exmh  so youll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on exmhusers or exmhworkers is having similar problems reg clemens said   if you havent already  you should enable the debug log under   hacking support preferences and look for clues there     reg clemens said      hi            on sun  01 sep 2002 000503 mdt reg clemens wrote                  in messages with gnupg signatures  but punching the line always       gives                     signature made thu aug 29 002717 2002 mdt using dsa key i d bdd        f997a               cant check signature public key not found             so  something else is missing           yes  the public key of the signature you want to check            are you really sure that you have the public key of the messages      signature if not  try downloading it or try to check a signature fro m      which you know you have the public key                        ah  sorry for not making that clearer     but no     previously v106 of gnupg there would be a slight pause at this poin t whi        le     it went out to get the public key from a keyserver     now  whether i have the key or not  i get the failure message         its as if it cant find gpg to execute it but i fixed that path  so th ere     must be something else that i am missing                                                          regclemens                                             regdwfcom                          exmhusers mailing list     exmhusersredhatcom     httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhusers        brent welch   software architect  panasas inc   pioneering the worlds most scalable and agile storage network   wwwpanasascom   welchpanasascom      partial solution  and this may be related to using tcltk 84b1  as i had a similar  problem about a month ago elsewhere in exmh which you found   but first  i really feel like something has changed out from under me  with my making no changes to exmh  namely  when i first got  gpg up and working for reading signatures all i did was  touch the check signature button and it went out and queried  the keyserver for me  now im getting a separate box  after the failure to find the  public key on my keyring  asking me of i want to query keyserver   i know that i never had to touch a query keyserver button in  the past  but there it is now  and i havent touched exmh spooky   i have been working back and forth between gpg 106 and 107  but its not clear how that could be the problem  as im now getting  the query message when running either      ok  enough about my confusion  the current problem seems to be a comment in a switch statement  at line 86 in pgpwwwtcl  tcl 84b1 doesnt like it and i get your  popup box  remove it and no popupbox  but exmh hangs sigh  so  not a complete solution  but at least a start   thanks for the interest   regclemens  regdwfcom  brent welch software architect  panasas inc pioneering the worlds most scalable and agile storage network wwwpanasascom welchpanasascom  exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhusers 
1864,0, hi everybody im writing a web application in java tomcat  jspservlets  database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is ecommerce  but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database  but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all  how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryptiondecryption the api that im using is the jca jdk14x  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object  and store in the database  but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database  but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password  i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesnt really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list  something i thought that can be of bit interest  but probabily wrong and insecure after all  im a real beginner in secure programming  and im here to learn methods and technics first of all  i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure  so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat  so it is not shared with other web services or  worst  the nobody user  that has no shell login  but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signaturermiwhatever else that the source is the right one  and handle all the database connections  or give the db connectionpassword to the main web application in this way  we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories  and also  an attacker should get rootbean user account to read data this is not perfect  and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means  really  another server running in the background any suggestions thank you  mario torre  please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see httpwwwfsforgphilosophynowordattachmentshtml

duncan beberg httpwwwmithralcombeberg bebergmithralcom  techs major decline college students turning away from bits and bytes by ellen mccarthy washington post staff writer tuesday  august 27  2002 page e01 if john yandziak had been entering college a few years ago  he might have sought a stake in the new economy he might have dreamed of becoming an ace codecracker for the cia or the national security agency  or imagined toppling an empire with revolutionary software maybe he would have tried to use the internet to end world hunger but as yandziak attends his first college classes this week  hes harboring different academic ambitions the ashburn native says he wants to do something more social and more interesting than working with computers besides  he said while packing for a charlottesville dormitory room  you cant get the chicks with that anymore the tech industrys financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of some fairweather students but now theres another consequence of the tech bust enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has come to a halt the number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in 2001  according to a report by the computing research association and educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating  with some colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins the word is out among department deans that the busts fallout has trickled into the classroom  said maria clavez  president of the association of computing machinery ive heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines  said clavez  who will become the dean of science and engineering at princeton university in january it can be hard to see this  because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space but it is going to have an effect at virginia tech  enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop 25 percent this year  to 300 at george washington university  the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the past decade in 1997  schools with phd programs in computer science and computer engineering granted 8 063 degrees  according to the computing research association the numbers rose through 2001  when 17 048 degrees were awarded the labor department projects that software engineering will be the fastestgrowing occupation between 2000 and 2010  with other computerrelated industries trailing close behind but in the short term that growth may slow  based on the changes among college students for example  900 of the 2 000plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at george mason university were computer science majors last year this year the enrollment in that major is down to 800  although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted 200 students having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief  said lloyd griffith  dean of george masons information technology and engineering school particularly with the field as it has been  they dont want to spend four years on something and then not get a job freshman enrollment for the university of marylands computer science major is expected to be about 167 this fall  down from 329 last year maryland decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent  but that alone does not account for the drop  said steve halperin  dean of marylands college of computer  mathematical and physical sciences we are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their interest in pursuing computer science as a major  halperin said thats a factual statement but i would say that at this point    we dont expect to see a decrease in the number of graduates many of the kids who are no longer expressing an interest in majoring in cs would have fallen off yandziak  who began at the university of virginia on saturday  is not convinced thats the case he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class  with a 39 gradepoint average  and nailed the highest possible score on his advancedplacement exam in computer science all of my classes have been easy for me math and sciences were always fun  so i looked for professions in which i could use those things  yandziak said im just not sure i want my life to be immersed in technology i want to do something that will contribute to the practical world harris n miller  president of the information technology association of america  said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals  salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage there was a tremendous imbalance in the late 90s potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now people are saying  i dont need this kind of it training right now   miller said our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment  down the road four years  as the economy picks up  once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices  but other factors  including program difficulty  personal interests and social influences  also come into play  said judy hingle  director of professional development at the american college counseling association the perception of computer science as an isolating  nerdy profession is one that many in the industry have tried to squelch that stereotype went underground during the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust all the hipness is gone  yandziak said once we thought of the internet as this thing with infinite capabilities it was basically just a fad that came along lamont thompson  a recent graduate of calvin coolidge senior high school in the district  is headed to morehouse college in atlanta to study business marketing  with the intention of going into real estate development technology comes natural to people my age its not fascinating anymore  thompson said to be honest with you  when i think computer science  i think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room its a necessity  but i wouldnt take it any further

1916,0, ok  lets bring some data into the discussion httpwwwgridanoclimatevital02htm a graph  derived from vostok ice core samples  of co2 and temperature fluctuations over the past 400k years  recent highresolution studies of historical co2 concentrations and  temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest  correlation between the two in a number of cases  co2 level increases  are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the  increase in temperature by a short time ie increases in temperature  preceded increases in co2 concentrations the more studies that are done  of the geological record  the more it seems that co2 concentrations are  correlated with temperature increases  but are not significantly  causative based on the vostok data  you are right  there is a very strong correlation between temperature and co2 concentrations  but it doesnt always appear to be causal  with respect to absolute co2 concentrations  it is also important to  point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly  regular cycle with a period of about 100 000 years also correct  the peak of each cycle is at about 290300 ppm co2  as it  happens  current co2 concentrations are within 10 of other previous  cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data not correct mauna loa data httpwwwgridanoclimatevital06htm and httpcdiacornlgovftpndp001maunaloaco2 show that the current co2 concentrations are at 370ppm  18 greater than the highest recorded value from the past 400k years furthermore  co2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years  much faster than any recorded increase in the vostok data though perhaps the vostok data isnt capable of such fine resolution  in other words  we may be adding to the co2 levels  no  we are definitely adding to co2 levels look at the following chart httpwwwgridanoclimatevital07htm shows co2 concentrations since 1870  the historical record not only is the co2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the vostok record  it is clear that the rate of change is increasing  not decreasing there is no other compelling explanation for this increase  except for anthropogenic input youre really out on the fringe if youre debating this  even global warming skeptics generally concede this point  but it looks a lot like we  would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical  record  at the very least  there is nothing anomalous about current co2  concentrations wrong again current co2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years  unless there is some mechanism that allows co2 levels to quickly spike  and then return back to normal background levels and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores still  by around 20752100 we will have reached 500 ppm co2  a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away  also  co2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately  affects temperature  again  the interaction is not entirely  predictable  but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative  feedback systems mentioned above yes  clouds and oceans are a big unknown still  we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store co2  and if the world temperature doesnt increase  but we all have seattlelike weather all the time  the effects would be enormous  last  as greenhouse gases go  co2 isnt particularly potent  although it  makes up for it in volume in some cases  gases such as water and  methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule  basis  water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas  something  that co2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the  biosphere correct data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses httpwwwgridanoclimatevital05htm note that methane concentrations now are much higher than preindustrial levels many cows farting  and rice paddies outgassing  and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas im in favor of reductions in methane levels as well data on water vapor here httpwwwaguorgscisocmocklerhtml  co2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism  but all the recent  studies and data ive seen gives me the impression that it is largely a  passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver i tend to think that holistic  and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming i favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar  wind and nuclear  with all carbonbased combustion using renewable sources of ch bonds aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense burying trees deep underground  for example approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a sustainable level are unrealistic  americans just wont do it youd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving suvs but  as california showed during last years energy crisis  shifts in patterns of consumption are possible  and improved efficiency is an easy sell  jim

1942,0, i agree with rob i think if the phones and mms is building traction in europe in handsets  this might be interesting bottom line is will it a help sell phones and b bill enough time on the wcarriers networks anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad low quality  small in size but kids totally dug that stuff seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs i dont think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography  developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc i think it expands the market and forms a new category the extent of the category size is the big question will it be a fad or will it a sustained market thats consumer behavior and marketing but i dont think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market in this case  digital photos or normal photos europes the one to watch  more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right  theyll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them h from rob shavell robmobiusvccom to mike masnick

is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing  i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting  my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eyes which can instantly share what they see amongst each other  that doesnt mean that people will stop talking on their phones  or that people will spend more time wimages than voice  just that it is fundamental  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes  i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes  changes things big time  rgds  rob   original message from mike masnick mailtomiketechdirtcom sent tuesday  august 20

content  that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications  its anything and everything  avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day  mainly humorous id guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words  this does nothing to answer my question  i do care about content  hell  if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day  id have a different opinion of this  i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not  while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made  how many people do you know who communicate by pictures  sure  it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism  but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something  i dont buy it  for most messages  text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism  for some messages  pictures do the job  but i would say not nearly as often as words  why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games  because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across  misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about 1 hour photo processing  trivial  who needs it  i get better resultion elswhere  and yet  it had great decentralizing impact  the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation  the digital camera  and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way  also  sms didnt take off because its easy  it took off because it costs less  its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth  in reality  sms cannibilizes the voice revs they bought their networks to handle  again  this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just dont understand kids today  and theyll run with this  i wasnt saying that mms wouldnt take off because it wasnt high quality or that it wasnt easy  i was saying that i couldnt see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications  im looking for the compelling reason even if its a stupid one why people would want to do this  sure  if they integrate cameras into the phone  and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people  but  mostly  i dont see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someones email address  or putting together an online or offline photoalbum  i dont think 1 hour photos are trivial  people want to see their own pics right away  and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots  thats one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on  the instant view part  im guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view  but also instant show  which is what this service offers  im not convinced that most people want instant show  i think people like to package their pictures and show them  thats why people put together fancy albums  and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture  sure  occasionally instant show is nice  but its just nice on occasion  i still cant see how it becomes a integral messaging method  whats the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another  there has to be some benefit  even if its silly if people are going to flock to it  im searching no one has given me a straight answer yet  the only really intriguing idea ive heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmors assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen  and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones  from all different angles  and those photos tell the real story of what happened  before the press even gets there  willing to be proven wrong  mike  ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are  then mms is never going to catch on

1957,0, the historical record  by which you mean human historical record  is highly overrated nigh worthless when you are talking about geological timescales  even on topics with as short a timescale as climate my problem with global warming or cooling for that matter  is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature  both in absolute terms and as a function time  very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last 50 000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change  people unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot  not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity  i therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in prehistory than in the last couple thousand years which have been relatively calm by geological standards  this is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda it is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age  they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization  the receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest  as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years  i dont see any compelling reason to save the glaciers anyway  particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient for anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another  ill just stick with occams razor for now in my humble opinion cheers  james rogers jamesrbestcom on mon  20020923 at 1223  jim whitehead wrote   for anyone to fully bury global warming  they would need to explain why the  dramatic increase in co2 concentrations are not increasing the global  temperature they would also need to explain why  worldwide  glaciers are  melting faster than they have previously in the historical record that is   people need more than refutations  they need a compelling alternate  explanation hint climate variability doesnt cover all the bases

opens this friday   michael    why is it that people who consider voting in an election an  inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message   dont get me wrong  i think this is the case  people will go to  see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to  express their malice and discontent towards not only the present  regime in america  but also the corrupt  empty  shallow pantomime  which cast them into power   in reality  today the voting that takes place via the act of  consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth  and dimpling the appropriate chad  or some other such convoluted act  of free democratic expression   why  because in america  they believe in dollars  dollars dont lie   in practise  they are the last frontier of truth in america   universally accepted as expressions of fear  desire  passion  and  need  compared to the swing of the almighty buck  and jeb bush knows  this  a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning   given that fact  i modestly propose an entirely new  though wholly  logical  extension to the current democratic system in place in  america   i propose we augment  and effectively replace  the electoral system  with a political stock market  we should accept that politicians are  entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america  and  embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects  their intent  a politician should issue a constant number of shares  dependent upon his tenure in government  those shares should be  traded on an open exchange  say the greed short  of course  for  the global realists electoral exchange  democratic  politicians  we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their  ability to maintain office grows  as the truth about their embezzling  campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is  revealed  of course  their fortunes will fall   this represents an opportunity for the market forces  those same  forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal  protest  to voice their opinion on the quality of americas  governance during the intervening four years between elections  elections themselves will in effect become meaningless  as they are  now  since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each  and every congressman  senator  and presidential candidate   just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc  strom  thurman strom news  quotes was down 15 today on fears that his  latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed  services committee meetings until november  this would provide  rejuvenating content to the econopolitical news sector  which has  found posteconomicbubble coverage to be both tiresome and  deoressing  the establishment of this new stock exchange would of  course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained  it systems engineers who could  after passing the electoral securities  exam  become floor traders   this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which  candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their  multibilliondollar campaigns  the requirement for the support of  legions of spin doctors  permanent campaign managers  and investor  relations personnel would also create jobs  perhaps even a new  practice for ernst  young  arthur anderson  et al  insider trading  scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch  martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary  thus spreading her  influence to politics   dividends  if there are any on record  at the close of a politicians  career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings  pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support  necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set  union funds  brokerages  and even pumpanddump houses could benefit  from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the  southeast  and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social  security bets where they really mattered   investors who lose their  retirement  life savings  and support could rest assured that they  were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors   although theres no way to protect any of these for worldcomlike  crashes  ambitious  inspired  district attorneys could file criminal  suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform  expectations  thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty   instead  they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves   on the whole  i believe the system could work  i could certainly work  as well as our beloved securities trading industry and  given the  american electoral systems success at effectively expressing the will  of the people  it certainly couldnt do any worse   in the meantime  mike  i think ill go see your movie and try to  depose the president   ian     on wednesday  october 9  2002  at 0353 pm  michael moores mailing  list wrote   october 9  2002   my film  bowling for columbine  opens this friday   dear friends  fans  and fellow evildoers   i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday  october 11   my  new  film  bowling for columbine  will open in new york and los angeles   it is  i promise  the last thing the bushies want projected on the  movie  screens across america this week the film is  first and foremost  a  devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for  profit  and power  and no one  in all the advance screenings i have  attended  has  left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this  film has  the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do  something   this is not good news for junior and company not when they are  trying to  drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his  constitutional right to own a highpowered rifle not when john  ashcroft is  still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background  check  files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased  any  weapons prior to 911  because that  we are told  would violate  these  terrorists sacred second amendment rights   yes  i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc  but i will  need all  of you to help me do this are you game   last february 5th  i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and  how  the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to  publish  anything critical of bush after 911 i appealed to you to save  stupid  white men from the shredder and to go out and buy it i promised you  would  not regret it  and that the book would not only be a great read but an  important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w bush   within 24 hours  the book went to 1 on the amazon best seller list  by the  fifth day  the book was already into its 9th printing the publisher  was  torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money  greed won  out  and this sunday the book enters its 31st week on the new york  times  best seller list  and its 32nd printing this is all because of  you  my  crazy and loyal friends you made this happen  against all the odds   now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work   bowling  for columbine its a movie that many critics have already called my  best  film to date they may be right it is certainly the most provocative  thing  i have ever done i have spent three years on it and  i have to say   it  cuts  deeper  harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far   the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles  and then in  8 more  cities next week how it does in these first ten cities will determine  whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it that is the  nutty  way  our films are released if it doesnt have a big opening weekend  you  can  kiss the film goodbye therefore  this weekend  this film must be  seen by  millions of americans can you help me make that happen   bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school  shootings  that is only the starting point for my 2hour journey into the dark  soul of  a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of  violence   both at home and around the world with this movie i have broadened my  canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st  century  a nation that seems hellbent on killing first and asking  questions  later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and  terrorism against our own poor  and how we have created a culture of  fear  that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and its a  devastating comedy   this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has  ever  said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be  attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of  retribution i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many  to  swallow   this is why i need your help movies live or die based on what  happens at  the box office the first weekend of its release i need you  if you  live in  the new york or la area  to go see bowling for columbine this  friday  and  saturday  and take as many family members and friends with you as  possible i guarantee you will not be disappointed  and you may  just see  one of the best films of the year   monday night in times square  bowling for columbine had its  premiere the  crowd was amazing  as it was this past saturday night at the chicago  film  festival the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud  throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line   the hate mail  the threats  the promises of retribution have already  started  to roll in to the distributor of this movie  united artists they are  not  backing down but how long will this last i need all of you in the  new  york  tristate and southern california areas to go see bowling for  columbine  this weekend  the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when  it  comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of  america  will see this film  it means that a good number of people who see it  are  going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved  if it  does poorly  i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the  movie  i want to make next  a film about 911 and how bush is using that  tragic  day as a cover for his rightwing agenda   dont let that happen dont let the nra have one more success by  stopping  the wider distribution of this movie and  together  let us not remain  silent in our opposition to bushs phony war against iraq   if you live in new york  you can see it at the lincoln plaza  the  sunshine  and the loews 19th st in la  you can catch it at the sunset 5  the  westwood regent  laemmle sunset  laemmle towncenter encino  landmark  rialto pasadena  and regal university irvine also  please  forward this  to your other friends and tell them to go see bowling for columbine  this  weekend   and finally  dont miss our new website wwwbowlingforcolumbinecom   thank you for your help with this i feel so honored and privileged  to have  so many people interested in my work last january i

2006,0, how about this   a bored forker said  yawn i believe tom had it right   signal not noise ill start los angeles times september 23  2002 monday copyright 2002  los angeles times los angeles times september 23  2002 monday  home edition section main news main news part 1 page 13 national desk length 1013 words byline dana calvo  times staff writer dateline seattle body the idea came at the end of a long  frustrating brownbag session at a publicpolicy think tank here the challenge was to save the citys childcare programs staring into his empty coffee cup  the meeting coordinators mind landed on an unlikely solution put a taxjust a benign dime a shoton espresso that led to a petition signed by more than 20 000 seattle residents  and next year  voters will decide whether the tax becomes law  one that taps right into seattles legendary addiction to coffee this is  after all  the town where starbucks was born and where the 12 pound of beans became a staple there is one starbucks for every 7 000 residents in seattle  compared to one per 64 000 in new york seattle also has two other major coffee chains  tullys coffee and seattles best coffee  as well as countless cafes and espresso carts a recent poll showed that 74 of seattle residents would vote for the tax for people outside of seattle who dont understand the consumption of espresso  the tax proposal can be seen as crazy  said john burbank  the think tanks executive director  but it was common sense research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold  a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol burbank estimates the tax could generate 7 million to 10 million a year city council aides dispute his figures  saying their research shows the tax would bring in 15 million to 3 million a year burbanks institute is funded by foundations and labor unions the think tanks mission is to promote public policy in the interests of lowincome people  and it has long championed childcare issues burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the childcare programs made earlier this year by gov gary locke he also says it would provide more lowincome families with subsidies for child care  improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries at bauhaus books  coffee  the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a halfday activity  not just a drink espresso lovers like chris altman  who at a dime a day would spend an extra 3650 a year  said the investment is worth it im ok with it  said the 35yearold  stirring his iced latte the moneys got to come from somewhere hope revuelto  25  was cooling her regular coffee 1 because she brought her own mug and reading zen and the art of pottery she supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso drinkers they want the most expensive thing on the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy some say the tax isnt the issue they just resent being singled out david marsh  45  a costume manager  drinks up to three espressos a day  which means hed be shelling out an extra 10950 a year i  for one  dont have kids  but i drink espresso  he said  as he sewed a leather collar onto a chainmail tunic i dont mind paying  but i think everyone should pay coffeehouses are steamed about it  and theyve organized as joltjoined to oppose the latte tax among the members are seattles chamber of commerce and the citys two largest coffee franchises  starbucks and tullys the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso  a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes  especially during the frantic morning rush if espresso counts come under suspicion  coffeehouse owners could face a city audit university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesnt add up the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable  and this is neither  he said on the efficiency side  its surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax for example  starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee  instead of coffee run though an espresso maker and that consequently  they are exempt from the tax would they be right i dont know  but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care of course  from a publicrelations perspective  this is an ingenious idea  and i mean that in a cynical way theyve pitted espresso drinkers against childcare supporters  and whos going to side with the espresso drinkers in fact  the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political twostep  where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness in a liberal city like seattle  corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism  and throughout the debate over the initiative  jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care starbucks will continue to support earlylearning and childhooddevelopment programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually  the company said however  starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages  or any other single consumer product the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year the initiatives authors say it is directed at vendors critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices  effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso  including decaf drip coffee would be exempt burbank says the tax would reach only a preselected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so  hes been pitching it as a modernday robin hood tax  where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend 3 to 4 on an espresso its the kind of political marketing that

2011,0, on wed  20021009 at 0648  frank bergmann wrote   a more reasonable explication of the eu  us differences according  to some american journalist cited in a german magazine  can someone  help me is that the american public perceives the rest of the world  basically as a thread  against which you have to defend yourself using  power this is not a correct assessment  the american public couldnt care less  however  the us intelligence community correctly perceives a threat  and it isnt the thirdworld  many european and other developed nations aggressively engage in covert operations against american interests  its been going on for years and isnt even news  things have stepped up in recent years and the us dod is none too pleased  for better or worse  the us is relatively good at that game too  as with most backwater wars  they are proxies for the interests of the big players find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the us  youll find that half the countries on that list are european  most people are unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years  on the other hand the europeans are used to the peace of their cozy  postwar system where external security is not an issue all security  threads can be resolved by giving money to the threatening people  and to integrate them into the wealthy sphere balkan  palestinians    bullshit  the european governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition  obviously some more than others  us specops are often brought in to do dirty work inside europe for european governments usually with government advisors along for the mission  ive always wondered what the deal was such that we got involved at all  the point being that weve acted as assassins for european governments inside their borders against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments  and in recent years  not ancient history  i know specop guys who left the military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these missions while they were posted for that duty im certainly glad i was never assigned missions in that theater  because there is a lot of covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly european democracies regardless  giving money to people that threaten you has never created meaningful peace in the history of civilization  we call it extortion under any other guise   a lot of the current eu  us issues can be explained by this difference  of perception  such as the current american unilateralism nobody wants  to help us  the american arrogance towards europe they dont want to  do anything  so why should we ask them and the growing rejection of the  american policy in europe they want to abolish the law europe is looking increasingly like a basket case  whatever problems the us is having these days  europe looks worse and is going downhill faster  why the us would want to emulate european behavior or the european way of doing things is beyond me the us asking for major policy advice from europe is like asking a quack for medical advice  i really dont see what is wrong with unilateral anyway  why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff i hope the incessant kneejerk conformist screeching that americans see coming from europe doesnt actually represent the views of europeans for various reasons im not exactly a cheerleader for the us government  but the premises of the argument against them here are lame  my personal point is that few americans percentage of overall population  have ever left their country  while even german construction workers  regularly spend their holidays in spain so im not surprised that  paranoia is growing im betting you are underestimating the actual percentage  the vast majority of people i know have lived  worked  and traveled outside the country at one time or another  and i doubt europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the western hemisphere as americans have despite the best efforts of france  europe is still not the center of the universe  ill throw you a bone though most americans do consider europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it  but from the perspective of an american  how could you not look at it this way  the impact of europe on america has diminished greatly over the years i love the smell of eurochauvinism in the morning first  you assume that the north american continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous  anybody that has actually traveled throughout north america knows this isnt true there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the us alone  never mind the hundreds of diverse regional subpopulations  some of which are truly foreign  apparently europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture  that would be like saying mexico is culturally identical to spain because they nominally speak the same language  a wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in san francisco  despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country  if i want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays  ill go to oakland  new orleans  or similar  they are far more different from where i live than some countries ive traveled to  and a lot of these places are farther from where i live than spain is from germany second  the state i live in is the size of germany  when i travel to a neighboring state which i do regularly  how is this not equivalent in fact  i probably travel much farther for the holidays than your german construction workers  if you look at the eu as a single country  only then does your analogy become comparable  what kind of ridiculous superiority do europeans get from having relatively tiny countries in truth  i find europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the us  there are a lot of cultural similarities across the eu with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the us  the only real difference is that europeans have dozens of different languages  which is hardly something i would call an advantage  although there are a couple parts of the us where i cant understand a word they are saying either james rogers jamesrbestcom

2042,0, oh  they were plenty upset about the tea taxes but the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the american colonies  and  btw  england as well dear ben franklin was right for the wrong reasons  first of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to england proper  second  the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement in fact  it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim  it sounds like a modern keynsian was creating an urban legend otoh the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling  imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering ious on your own name  and then trying to market  exchange the paper as the merchant who took the iou  the most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money  the effects are a complete disaster  there are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid so almost all the literature talks about that but you can also screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation  the fundamental cause of the american great depression was exactly this  courtesy of the federal reserve board i dont think shifting the power to print money to the bank of canada had much effect  and canada is still a prosperous country  original message  from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of gary  lawrence murphy  sent saturday  september 21  2002 731 am  to mr fork  cc forkexamplecom  subject re sed sunited statesroman empireg    f  fork list mr writes       f free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift      f whole societies out of poverty im not a      f sociopoliticalhistory buff  does anybody have some clear      f examples   china  ooops  no wait  scratch that   there is one counter example that i can think of  but it may not be  precisely free trademarkets  when ben franklin first visited  england he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous  ben  explained that they used colonial script  a kind of barterdollar   and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment  the  british bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to  clamp down on the practice  within a few years  the colonies were  rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the empire   according to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political  party here in canada  the founding fathers had no real complaint about  tea taxes  it was the banning of colonial script they were  protesting if this is true  then it comes right back to the forces  that killed ned ludds followers as to why popular opinion believes  they were protesting a tea tax  the same pamphlet claimed that canada  was also a prosperous nation until  by an act of parliament in the  late50s or early 60s  the right to print money was removed from the  juristiction of parliament and handed over to the bank of canada   ive wondered about all this  certainly the timeline of the collapse  of the canadian economy fits the profile  but there are oodles of  other causes for example  spending money like we had 300m people when  we only had 20m anyone have any further information on this     gary lawrence murphy  garymteledyncom  teledynamics communications    blog httpwwwauracomcomteledyn  biz httpteledyncom     computers are useless they can only give you answers picasso

2045,0, guido  there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale picketts  hammiepy  and the original gbayespy  according to the readmetxt   gbayespy hasnt been kept up to date it seemed that way to me when i ripped the classifier out of it  i dont think anyone has touched it after  is there anything in there that isnt covered by hammiepy someone else will have to answer that i dont use gbayes or hammie  at least not yet  about the only useful feature of gbayespy that hammiepy doesnt yet  copy is u  which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox  this  feature can easily be copied into hammiepy thats been done now  right  gbayespy also has a large collection of tokenizers but timtokenpy  rules  so im not sure how interesting that is now those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if theyre interesting  the tiny spamham collections in gbayes are also worthless now  the self test feature didnt do anything except print its results testerpy since became doctested and verifies that some basic machinery actually delivers what its supposed to deliver  therefore i propose to nuke gbayespy  after adding a u feature 1 here  anyone against

2048,0,  from bitbitchmagnesiumnet mailtobitbitchmagnesiumnet   burbank says the tax would reach only a preselected group of  consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so  hes been  pitching it as a modernday robin hood tax  where the needy get a dime  every time the affluent spend 3 to 4 on an espresso the people who pour the espresso arent rich  an interesting issue might be how it affects employment still  it is a 1 or less sales tax  that might not make that big of a difference the costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous worse than the cost of the tax itself me i hate coffee anyway  but if they put a 10can tax on diet dr pepper i might have to start buying them in oregon  yes  i drink that much diet dr pepper

2115,0, one of the most bizarre pages ive seen on the web at first i thought it might be some sort of backstory to a rpg  but  nope  it looks like somebody believes this  httpwwwvikingzorgr20ihtm m09 dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil dinosaurs reptoid ets are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on their hind legs this is a description of a dinosaur it now appears in remote viewing that the reptoid ets  dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on earth the erideans who are reptoid derivatives have a home planet in the eridanus system like all other ets the reptoids have no reported home planet they also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit this is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them thus it could be that the reptoids  erideans  nordics  anunnaki  but not the greys  all have origins on earth and have a strong link to earth even if they choose to live elsewhere the greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on earth the definitive work on dragons is the flight of dragons by peter dickinson if dragons did exist in the flesh  they did not survive the long bow targets do not come much bigger truth is stranger than fiction thus the writers current scenario is that there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard their eggs and young  and who probably preferred to live underground they survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet for them possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the dinosaurs they must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also to appear to some people they have appeared to the writer in remote viewing they are living on as vampire entities such immortal minds are contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers if they can be encouraged to reincarnate  then the power sources of the black magicians and mind controllers will disappear encouraging them to reincarnate will help so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great difficulty surviving reincarnation purging peoples dinosaurs should remove all perverse psychic abilities not under their control they are a source of satanic guardian angels and demons they control us by owning our psi thus if we regain ownership of psi  we must relinquish their control and that of all other mind controllers encourage people to regain ownership of their psi the origins of love  hate and pure malice the following scenario appears to hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of rotting vegetation a good source of beetles and grubs for young hatchelings they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm  which made them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change in order to keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control to do this they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators this is an act of hatred and outward looking while a few dinosaurs did develop the ability to bear living young  most did not the dinosaurs got in first and so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds they have become the source of all satans  devils and demons birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep them warm a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs say one per day and only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid thus all eggs tend to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth this is primarily an act of love but inward looking bearing live young is not suitable to a bird of the air a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm  even if they are standing on ice mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking this is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young  while birds and mammals developed love birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young  but this is secondary if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician  then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control  regardless of the front they put out to the public religion tends to concentrate on how to brainwash your neighbour conscious thought has built many mighty empires  theologies and slave control systems out of using how to care for and protect ones young as a foundation thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something a load of dinosaurs eggs purging the dinosaurs and dinosaurs eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings  aided and abetted by various occultists and other as they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer  he encourages them to reincarnate items for inspection for mind control to take place  then someone must take control or ownership of the targets psi and pleasure centres check for the following nest of dinosaurs eggs  holy dinosaurs  etc eggs  controllers or owners in peoples psi  pleasure centres  pain killing hormones  abilities  etc mind machines the original engraving or engram god and satan appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right t hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams no doubt dinosaurs were the first job holders timetracks are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of time my  our  mans timetracks  etc the time tracks of the universe  universal subconscious  galactic subconscious  etc extinct races of ets can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices whenever one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes  suspect that the higher plane is a vampire one one may never know what they looked like or other basic characteristics  which makes linking back a trifle difficult every extinct race  etc blood ancestors are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via genetic linkages some of these can be over 2 000 years old every blood ancestor  ancestral mind  genetic mind  etc

one way  the fbiwinter hill vs patriarchaangiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs put crudely  and at its most racist  the fbi and the winter hill gang were the mostly irish thugs  and patriarchas family were  of course  the mostly italian thugs think scorseses upcoming gangs of new york  only with counterreformatory overtones hoovers south boston socialclub putsch  starting in the mid 1960s  was particularly audacious in hindsight the us federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibitionera capture of the nations rackets by the italians from the irish the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york  but for south boston  the most irish place in the us  only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all the result  as we all found out  wasnt swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone hoover was  posthumously  swapping it for oxycontin  or crystal methamphetamine   or  more properly  pcp the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulgers crackcocaineera reign of bostons drug markets  like the identical fbisponsored reigns or violent horror by other alsorans in cities across the us as a whole  went up whole orders of magnitude  not mere percentage points as stalin said once  quantity has a quality all its own and  make no mistake  j edgar hoover was directly responsible that quality of carnage  nationwide so  yes  on paper at least  it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another  and the result was  on paper  at least  business as usual same stuff  different century  with apparently decent people like mr salvati etal accidently ground on the gears of justice like so much hamburger however  to be much more macabre about it  that hamburger was greasing  if you will  an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love

busybodies it all starts  like all true evil does  from the most innocent of beginnings what she couldnt do to alcohol  teatotaling mrs grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller  manageable demand the bloody result was  like nine more heads of the hydra  an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition  in more markets  and for more things  as the 20th century wore on every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive  or harmful  or physically distasteful  or carcinogenic  or  now  apparently  fattening  and then prohibited  exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years a larger market than before the prohibition hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newlylegislated barriers to competition imposed on them by the state increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances and  finally  the ultimate in evil  the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end  increasingly coercive axehandle beatings  by our own government  of the sacred liberty of the average  but now unavoidablylawbreaking  citizenry as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago  you dont need government if nobodys breaking the law in some twisted corollary to parkinsons law  governments  to survive  need more people  breaking more laws  or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time and  to bring us back to the point  david friedman would probably echo here his father miltons famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market  and never the consumer  much less the economy as a whole even  especially  if those sellers are breaking the law  as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us and there  absent the apparent grace of mr hoover  went mr salvati in fact  hayek himself  in the road to serfdom  couldnt have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoovers blatant imposition  for our own good  of vietnamera statist power at the neighborhood level and  furthermore  stalin couldnt have had better useful idiots than hoover did  and neither  by an absolutely literal extension  did whitey bulger after hoover useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle idiots who were eating out of hoovers powercraven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century  and whitey bulgers hand  whether they knew it or not  until the end of the millennium a time  youll notice  which saw

movieflopping  bureaupumping  naziappeasing irishbostonian little caesar or  as for that matter  his safely trustfunded  and now strictly political  descendents in terms of actual financial economics  think of what happened to mr salvati and the others  dead or alive  as a transferprice  in human lives  of the inevitable consequence of macnamarastyle vietnamera keynesian socialcost inputoutput accounting at its most despicable  and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover  and his coreligionists in state economic control  in the name of what really was  as youll now agree  just a race war between thugs up in boston this shouldnt be a surprise  really all race wars are at least fought by thugs  though theyre usually conceived elsewhere  and endorsed  at the time  by all the right people  for all the right reasons as far as the fbi itself goes  remember mancur olsons observation that a prince is just a stationary bandit though  given his penchant for womens clothing  for other men  and  whats actually obscene  for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference  i suppose we can call j edgar hoover a bandit princess

the new york times august 25  2002 hoovers fbi and the mafia case of bad bedfellows grows by fox butterfield boston  aug 24  it was march 1965  in the early days of j edgar hoovers war against the mafia fbi agents  say congressional investigators  eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new englands organizedcrime boss  raymond patriarca two gangsters  joseph barboza and vincent flemmi  wanted mr patriarcas permission to kill a smalltime hoodlum  edward deegan  as they were having a problem with him  according to an fbi log of the conversation patriarca ultimately furnished this ok  the fbi reported  and three days later mr deegan turned up dead in an alley  shot six times it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two wellknown gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved but when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967  the real killers  who also happened to be informers for the fbi  were left alone four other men were tried  convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder  though they had had nothing to do with it one  joseph salvati  who spent 30 years in prison  filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the fbi for 300 million for false imprisonment his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the fbi  the justice department and some fbi agents growing out of the tangled  corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the fbis boston office in its effort to bring down the mob the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light  including documents detailing conversation in which mr patriarca approved the murder they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform  which has pressured the department into turning over records about the fbi in boston the documents show that officials at fbi headquarters  apparently including mr hoover  knew as long ago as 1965 that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution j edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself  said vincent garo  mr salvatis lawyer he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants mr barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr salvati and may have implicated him because mr salvati owed 400 to a loan shark who worked for mr barboza asked about the documents showing that mr hoover knew of mr salvatis innocence when he was put on trial  gail marcinkiewicz  a spokeswoman for the fbi in boston  declined to comment  citing the pending litigation a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office in one of the first results of the investigation  one retired agent  john j connolly  is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were fbi informers  james bulger and stephen flemmi vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers the government reform committee  led by representative dan burton  republican of indiana  has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureaus knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr barboza were involved in killing mr deegan a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime  including who fired the first shot then  on june 4  1965  mr hoovers office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer in a reply five days later  the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr patriarca potentially could be an excellent informant the agent also informed mr hoover that mr flemmi was known to have killed seven men  and  from all indications  he is going to continue to commit murder nevertheless  the agent said  the informants potential outweighs the risk involved a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmis murders  the director does not even respond  the investigator said there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia  which he had largely ignored in boston  fbi agents recruited mr barboza and mr flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization  the winter hill gang  led by mr bulger both sides got what they wanted  according to the investigations and the trial of mr connolly the fbi got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families  which controlled organized crime in new england mr bulgers gang was able to take over the rackets in boston  sell drugs and even commit murder while the fbi looked the other way one reason the fbi may not have used its information about mr patriarcas involvement in the deegan murder  congressional investigators say  is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence  ri  headquarters the fbi agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants  to disguise the use of the device  the investigators say mr salvati  a former truck driver  now 69  had his sentence commuted in 1997 by gov william f weld last year  while he was still on parole  his murder conviction was dismissed by a massachusetts state judge after the justice department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison their survivors have joined the fourth man  peter limone  in a 375 million lawsuit against the justice department mr limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair his life was spared only when massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974 mr salvati lives in a modest apartment in bostons north end with his wife  marie  who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years each week mr salvati sent her a romantic card  which she put on the television set it was  mr garo said  all they had of each other begin pgp signature version pgp 75

2297,0, from the bbc website  wwwbbccouk tuesday  8 october  2002  0943 gmt 1043 uk fake bank website cons victims  west african criminals have used a fake version of a british banks online service to milk victims of cash  say police the fake site was used to squeeze more money out of people they had already hooked  the site has been shut down but uk national criminal intelligence service  ncis  said at least two canadians had lost more than 100 000 after being taken in by the fake website  the scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various african nations  ncis said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would otherwise spot the scam  convincing site  news of this latest scam was revealed by bbc radio5live it found that an unclaimed web domain of a uk bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out their victims a ncis spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had the in front of the banks name  i have seen the microsite myself and its very sophisticated  said the ncis spokesman its very convincing especially to people not very experienced online  once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down however  the people behind it have not been caught  ncis does know that at least two people have lost more than 100 000  the bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again domain games  usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as advanced fee or 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or email offering a share of any cash successfully moved out of africa  the 419 refers to the part of the nigerian penal code dealing with such crimes  like any con  there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash  although this con has been practiced for years  people still fall victim to it  ncis estimates that up to five americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in london everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con  cutting edge fraud  often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of legitimacy   people tricked into clicking on fake sites  but a spokesman for ncis said fake or spoof websites are now being used in place of the certificates  to many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web technology  said the spokesman  one of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the south african reserve bank  the countrys national bank  typically  victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has been deposited in their name  but before they can get their hands on the cash  the victims are typically asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead  once the south african police discovered the ruse they declared it a national priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it  modern gloss  an briefing paper prepared by ncis in august on organised crime noted that criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give old cons a modern gloss  the ncis spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come forward and help it track down the perpetrators he said in the last two months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud  he said any email  fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be true  undoubtedly is  one of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment service paypal  conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and reenter their account and credit card details because paypal had lost the information  the website link included in the email looked legitimate but in fact directed people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmens personal use  yahoo groups sponsor  sell a home for top  httpusclickyahoocomrrpzmcjtmeaamvfiaa7gsolbtm  to unsubscribe from this group  send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom  your use of yahoo groups is subject to httpdocsyahoocominfoterms

2333,0, original message from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcomon behalf of robert harley sent monday  september 02  2002 255 am to forkexamplecom subject re java is for kiddies reza bfar wrote this thread kind of surprises me i started coding with c  then c  and moved on to java and  i think that robert harley wrote looks like a case of my experience is comprehensive  yours is anecdotal  they dont know what theyre talking about well  i sure dont claim that i think most people on fork probably have more programming knowledge than i do theres lots of experience out here reza bfar wrote 1  the people who pay the wages dont give a flyin heck what programming language you write things in they just want it to work robert harley wrote in my experience  they do care  it has to work certainly  and in particular it has to work with what theyve already got  and it has to work on clients systems my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and havent come back yet well  i think until recently  support for most things on linux was kind of shady things have got much better youre right in that the jdk used to suck on linux but then  imho  linux is still maturing or at least development tools for linux are maturing ive been developing a few server side apps that run on linux recently with jdk 13x and theyve had no problems with great performance robert harley worte microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a service pack  somehow  i cant imagine them removing the ability to run c programs hmmm do you really think that ms is pulling out java because its a bad programming language or application platform  you dont think this has anything to do with net being a competitor to java do you  or that ms has basically copied java with some additional features and called it c isnt that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applications reza bfar wrote 2  c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory management over and over again robert harley wrote cant say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management issues  apart from the fact that i frequently need  4 gb hmmm again youre telling me that youve never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak  i am not the best cc programmer not even close but ive known really good ones and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management  however occasional they may be its about design patterns  architecture  high level stuff robert harley wrote if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve  then its trivial anyway irrespective of language wow  so youre telling me that unless the application involves bitcounting  its trivial  what about the application itself  what about high level problems such as task distribution  workflow  etc  arent most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal cc code  for example  do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks there are lots of them on this list  are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over and over again robert harley wrote you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time on irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers dont  depends entirely on the programmer  not the language i can see how you could infer this however  what i believe to really be the case is that java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers  in those cases  its always very hard to get the programmers to agree on apis  memory management techniques  etc  with java  the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you dont sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a database jdbc or a messaging bus jms 3  java is not just a programming language its also a platform robert harley wrote buzzword yikes  have you written db code with cc for different databases just an example  tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix  say you have informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sql bad ideabut for the sake of the example  would you rather deal with jdbc port or cc port that uses informix drivers and now you have to use odbc a monolithic set of apis or a crap load of different apis slicing and dicing the same problems 50 different ways robert harley wrote unsupported assertion so  are you saying that there is a standard set of apis for cc for everything aside to the minimal ansi stuff  is there a standard way of dealing with cc applications for various domain problems messaging  database persistence  etc that rivals java  id like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes cc in that case  i claim ignorance not suggesting that java is the golden hammer just that cc is overkill for most things i even coded in vb but vb is a true disgrace to programming its just lame java is object oriented no flamemail from the antioo people please that is a religious discussion and relatively clean and i dont think that every kid can write a well designed java program  kids typically dont understand various design patterns and principles to my experience  they actually tend to think more of the low level problems  wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world a tendency that is much more possible  imho  in cc than in java due to existence of standard apis

2358,0, first  misattribution  i did not write the blurb below  i made one statement about vp cheney only  to wit  that he has a short memory i couldnt agree with you more on this in short  then

otherwise  however  i resent being lumped in a zerosumzealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and successful at face value is apropos of nothing and i am beginning to understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad hominem re cheney align themselves weird sylogisms like if rich then deservedly or if rich then smarter  given that  i am also beginning to understand why some people need to be rich wrt to meritocracies  all hail  meritocracies  wrt harvard over 90 of 2002 graduates were cum laude  interesting curve  those eager to be measured got their

geege schuman wrote  most of them seem to have ivy league educations  or are ivy league  dropouts suggesting to me that they werent exactly poor to start  with actually  if i remember correctly from discussion of the lists composition in forbes about five or six years ago  the best way to get on the forbes 400 is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps  boys and girls i knew you could given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school  like  say  mine    is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a governmentrun high school  youll probably get more of those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing transferpayment depression an economic version of this summers governmentforest conflagration  caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this summer  that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out there  including me    to learn to actually feed themselves the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a terminal professional degree  like an mba  phd  md  etc  from the best school possible why because  as of about 1950  the best way to get into harvard  for instance  is to be smart  not rich dont take my word for it  ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof meritocracy  american style  was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint    and  of course  chicago taught them all how  right  practically nobody who goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless  of course  their parents  who couldnt afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so and their kids still had to get the grades  and biased by intelligence   test scores  to get in the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees  until they actually own something and hire people  or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people who dont work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone is smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow btw  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that im using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri  and i dont have a degree in anything actually useful  much less a terminal one  which means im broker than anyone on this list  its just that you  of all people  lots with educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and economics is not a zerosum game the cost of anything  including ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case  intelligence and effort i will  however  admit to being educated waay past my level of competence  and  by the way you discuss economics  so have you  apparently btw  if we ever actually had free markets in this country  including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes  all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money  and there would be more selfmade people on that list in addition  most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it  not even relatively speaking finally  practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else  investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress  for those of you in the peoples republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff  cheaper  over time  a terrible  petitbourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite  or youd know about it by now in economic terms  its also called an increase in general welfare  and  no  virginia  im not talking about extorting money from someone who works  and giving it to someone who doesnt in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time in short  then  economics is not a zero sum game  property is not theft  the rich dont get rich off the backs of the poor  and redistributionist labor theory of value happy

2371,0, from httpwwwarstechnicacom there has mostly been talk thus far and little action  but the department of justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against individuals 1 who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted material over the internet deputy assistant attorney general john malcolm believes that criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of americas content industries malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity i certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distributionbarring provisions such as fair useis not authorized  and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpfuli think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution  said riaa president cary sherman  who was on the same conference panel im not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect sherman is hoping for although infrequent  there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals  and they have served as minor deterrents to the filesharing community at large criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the riaa and may be difficult to initiate because of the schooling effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd the article cites the no electronic theft net act 2  which defines illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement criminal infringement any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain  or by the reproduction or distribution  including by electronic means  during any 180day period  of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works  which have a total retail value of more than 1 000 for purposes of this subsection  evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work  by itself  shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement  the term financial gain includes receipt  or expectation of receipt  of anything of value  including the receipt of other copyrighted works therefore  receipt of a work of value would be defined as financial gain even if no money is involved the net act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined an album or movie could be worth only 15 to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder the statute of limitations 507 limitations on actions a criminal proceedingsno criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose b civil actionsno civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued the penalties are too extensive to list here  but they can be found in section 2319 criminal infringement of a copyright in general  firsttime criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year im still not sure where the doj would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned schooling effect  but my guess would be that  just like speeding  primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers thanks to monalisaoverdrive for pointing out this story  1 httpnewscomcom21001023954591htmltagfdtop 2 httpwwwusdojgovcriminalcybercrime1718redhtm httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork

2418,0, reza bfar wrote this thread kind of surprises me i started coding with c  then c  and moved on to java and  i think that looks like a case of my experience is comprehensive  yours is anecdotal  they dont know what theyre talking about 1  the people who pay the wages dont give a flyin heck what programming language you write things in they just want it to work in my experience  they do care  it has to work certainly  and in particular it has to work with what theyve already got  and it has to work on clients systems my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and havent come back yet microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a service pack  somehow  i cant imagine them removing the ability to run c programs 2  c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory management over and over again cant say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management issues  apart from the fact that i frequently need  4 gb its about design patterns  architecture  high level stuff if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve  then its trivial anyway irrespective of language i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over and over again you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time on irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers dont  depends entirely on the programmer  not the language 3  java is not just a programming language its also a platform buzzword a monolithic set of apis or a crap load of different apis slicing and dicing the same problems 50 different ways unsupported assertion 4  if you have a program of any type of high complexity written in c  you cant possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within the same magnitude of cost as java dunno  eg  i ported a wee 15000line c program to darwin on powerpc in a few minutes yesterday  sure if it was badly designed it would be 10 times the size and harder to port  if it depended on unavailable libraries it would be much harder  portable code is easy to port at least that is the case when then language you used is available on the target platform i also run on arm systems with no proper java 5  makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a person java  imho  reduces the dependence of these entities on the individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer java as it is to reverse engineer c large applications you can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now  or else get some kids to hack spaghetti fortran in any language and then pay for maintenance headaches ad infinitum  6  hardware is getting so fast that im not sure if the performance difference between java and cc are relevant any more whoah  performance matters to me every day  right now im taking time out to write email while waiting for a job to run  sure i could wait 5 years until everyones pc is fast enough to generate random ecs in no time  when any twit will be able to program inefficient code that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors  or i can do it now when very few people can  the end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved yes and for those problems  languages such as java  smalltalk  and others allow you to think more high level than low level  thinking of bits and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important problems its true  i admit everything  mea maxima culpa  working in c makes me spend all day thinking base  rank thoughts about hardcore bitography not actually i spend most of my time thinking in highlevel mathematics why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems over and over again  dunno  and frankly i dont see the relevance to the issue at hand im sure java is fine for some stuff  as is c or whatever  horses for courses bye  rob

2463,0, right mike  i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart  my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing  i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eyes which can instantly share what they see amongst each other  that doesnt mean that people will stop talking on their phones  or that people will spend more time wimages than voice  just that it is fundamental  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes  i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes  changes things big time rgds  rob

this  but at 1136 pm 82002 0700  rob shavell wrote content who cares about content  that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications  its anything and everything  avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day  mainly humorous id guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question  i do care about content  hell  if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day  id have a different opinion of this  i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made  how many people do you know who communicate by pictures  sure  it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism  but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i dont buy it for most messages  text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism  for some messages  pictures do the job  but i would say not nearly as often as words  why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games  because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about 1 hour photo processing  trivial  who needs it  i get better resultion elswhere  and yet  it had great decentralizing impact  the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation  the digital camera  and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way  also  sms didnt take off because its easy  it took off because it costs less  its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth  in reality  sms cannibilizes the voice revs they bought their networks to handle again  this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just dont understand kids today  and theyll run with this  i wasnt saying that mms wouldnt take off because it wasnt high quality or that it wasnt easy  i was saying that i couldnt see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications im looking for the compelling reason even if its a stupid one why people would want to do this  sure  if they integrate cameras into the phone  and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people  but  mostly  i dont see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someones email address  or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i dont think 1 hour photos are trivial  people want to see their own pics right away  and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots  thats one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on  the instant view part  im guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view  but also instant show  which is what this service offers  im not convinced that most people want instant show  i think people like to package their pictures and show them  thats why people put together fancy albums  and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture  sure  occasionally instant show is nice  but its just nice on occasion  i still cant see how it becomes a integral messaging method whats the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another  there has to be some benefit  even if its silly if people are going to flock to it im searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea ive heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmors assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen  and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones  from all different angles  and those photos tell the real story of what happened  before the press even gets there willing to be proven wrong  mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are  then mms is never going to catch on

2507,0, definitional nit to pick robert harley writes  it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly   precisely identical between males and females   of course the shapes of the distributions may differ youve redefined promiscuity above as total or average activity  which seems to rob it of its common meaning activity above some specific threshold usually one or norm  or involving extra or indiscriminate variety promiscuity is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages consider a population of 3 males and 3 females let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once then  let one of the males also have sex with the other two females sure  the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes  tautologically but here more women than men are  above the single partner threshold  above the overall average 167 actspartners threshold  above the overall median 15 actspartners  above the overall mode 1 actspartners and here women have a higher mode 2 and median 2 number of partners so in this contrived population  females are more promiscuous than males  unless promiscuity is defined uselessly  gordon

2511,0, first  it was my understanding that they had the food before they refused to pay  i often have the goods in my possession before i settle the paycheck second  not being paid for a little food is an awfully big deal in india  it isnt far from stealing the only food my children have so ill have to watch them starve  the margin of survival is very  very  thin so yes  in my particular reality distortion field not paying for a little food in india is akin to a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering if not death on the victims family  that such an act triggers a violent response is  imho  hardly surprising in other words  as far as i could tell the people on the train fired the first shot with all of that said i still dont know if this happened or not  nor do i know for sure that the margin of survival for those muslim vendors was that thin  original message  from stephen d williams mailtoswilliamshpticom  sent monday  september 16  2002 1154 am  to johnhallevergonet  cc forkexamplecom lealignet  subject re slaughter in the name of god   wow  it seems you are evaluating this with a large reality distortion  field   if the activists on the train refused to pay for food  then the vendors  shouldnt give it to them  and the local police force should be  arresting them  etc   you have to be operating from a particularly primitive point of view   which obviously was in operation with the participants here  to think  that religious differences or not being paid for a little food or  taunting was even a remote justification for burning a train full of  people alive   sdw   john hall wrote   what i understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for   the food and other items they acquired from the muslim vendors  then   taunted them     that may not be true  but it would put things in a more interesting   light  taking food from a small vendor in india and not paying them is   trying to starve them     it sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of   activists     im rarely an apologist for muslims anywhere  yet i find my sympathies   with the muslims in this case  even after they burned the train        from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of  stephen d williams      the pity of it is that some  muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the  trainload of vhp activists at godhra with its awful  atavistic     echoes    of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the  partition riots of 1947 played right into the hindu extremists     hands   sdw    swilliamshpticom httpwwwhpticom  stephen d williams  senior technical director

halfhearted attempts in this direction  as i am forced to use windows during the day i say halfhearted because im still applicationcentric  and i dont go as far with keyboard shortcuts as i could but i dont use the desktop at all never have  on any system  and i dont use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because i personally find them awkward ymmv if you must use windows  the first step towards a productive system is managing your start menu i use the main level of the start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs 0 control panel3  1 mozilla4  2 emacs5  3 dos home  4 dos work  5 dos incoming each of which gives me a command line  but in different directories  7 python6  9 ie also  explorer home   explorer work   explorer incoming  which open explorer windows in various useful directories the same directories as the dos shortcuts  only with the shift key held down  and yes  i intentionally set it up so that  went to my work folder lessused programs are taken out of their useless submenus as installed and moved directly into the programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed adaware7  excel8  im  netscape 49  paint shop pro  query tool odbc10  vmware11  word12 all other submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu yes  delete accessories do you honestly ever use it if so  its probably a sign of a larger productivity problem things which never need to be run manually like winzip and quicktime are removed from the programs menu maintaining a clean programs menu is an ongoing struggle  but well worth it on most modern keyboards  there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu  which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys otherwise ctrl esc always works menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory menu p n runs netscape 4 for compatibility testing in my day job  ugh mozilla and emacs are almost always open  but i quit lesserused applications as soon as im done using them mostly because my laptop doesnt have a lot of memory i install cygwin13 so that the command line is actually useful cygwin is a collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities  including mv  cp  scp  ssh  man  tar  less  grep  patch  ncftp  cvs  and many others and bash  which i dont use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 almost full screen at 1024 x 768  and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000 set window position at 0 x 0  and dont let the system position the window in mozilla  i set my home page to aboutblank  set internet search to search with google  use tabbed browsing  open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases  always show the tab bar  and load links in the background essential for weblog surfing  you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background under scripts  plugins  i do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows i turn off the sidebar  turn on the site navigation bar  delete all preinstalled bookmarks  and create two bookmarks one which takes me to my webmail  and another which takes me to my internal site search14  from which i can find all other bookmarks i need in internet explorer  i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog  since thats the only thing i do in internet explorer alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pguppgdown between tabs within mozilla  since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs  making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible i use emacs locally and vi remotely  because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable for instance  editing a cgi script named foocgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foocgi backup file  which is worldreadable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks try this sometime on your favorite web site among other things  my emacs file which is actually called emacs on windows instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory dbackup to treat all xml files as docbook  all cgi scripts as python  and all sql scripts as plsql to use cygwins bash shell for mxshell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar  titled as the name of the current file to show column numbers to accept y and n for yesno questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press mw i use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepadexe to get all text files to open in emacs i got this idea from ultraedit15 my emacs file is my second most backedup possession i dont use windows useless directory structure for user home directories on my d drive i have dhome contains directories for my books and other personal projects  each under cvs control8212also set as my home directory using the home environment variable  dwork contains directories for each work project  also under cvs  dincoming set as default download directory for all programs that download things  and dbackup used by emacs  and for temporary storage  for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created cvs projects i dont know or care whats where on my c drive i have tried many  many address books  and still store all my contacts  email addresses  snail mail addresses  phone numbers  and other vital personal information in a text file called phone  stored in dhomephone it is not in any particular format  other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries i categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name  and use mxoccur in emacs to search by keyword this file is my single most backedup possession other essential free windows utilities i use

2525,0, this is not an exmh problem  but an interaction between sendmail  solaris and mh your sysadmin is wrong  it is the responsibility of the receiving mail server to escape lines beginning with from  if they choose to turn on that facility  it is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool  and suns even more stupid decision to rely on contentlength instead of dealing with this problem  since mh is unaware of contentlength  rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the spool i had this same problem  there are several ways to fix it 1  get your mail administrator to add the e flag to your sendmail  this means you will never see a line beginning with from   any such line will look like from  2  there is a patch to mh to make it respect contentlength  when i was having this problem  porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list  then nmh development stalled for a long time  i doubt it has been done  but you can check with the nmh list at nmhworkersmhostcom to find out for sure 3  you can learn to use procmail  invoking rcvstore directly instead of letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool  this avoids the whole issue  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time  and everything works  jim mcmaster mailtomcmasjctatankastortekcom in message 200210091657g99gvdmx025433lifeaimitedu  jason rennie said   when i receive a message that has a line starting with from   its  broken into two messages  i get my mail from varspoolmail  the  program that incorporates mail thinks that the from  line starts a new  message   my sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to  escape lines begining with from   exmh 25 doesnt do this  should  it  it appears that my mh is mh 68  does nmh fix this   jason d m rennie  mit ai lab  jrennieaimitedu  617 2535339  httpwwwaimitedujrennie        exmhusers mailing list  exmhusersredhatcom  httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhusers   exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhusers

2529,0, cant think of how id be running afoul of the spam filters with this post  so heres the second try kissingers book does america need a foreign policy provides a few handy abstractions  the ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between  values idealism and interests realism and  occasionally   between peace and justice also  he views historical american approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers hamiltonian  we should only get involved in foreign adventures to preserve balances of power wilsonian  we should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy  etc jacksonian  we should never get involved in foreign adventures unless were attacked  then we go rambo he has tactfully left out the hard realists as for the rest i gather wilsonians play the idealists  and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect  and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap kissinger himself seems to be a hamiltonian much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions maybe ive been too affected by kant  but i cant see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a bismarck runnning it how lopsided does the us look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics  dave   the road to empire leads to domestic decay because  in time  the claims  of omnipotence erode domestic restraints  no empire has avoided the  road to caesarism unless  like the british empire  it devolved its  power before this process could develop  in longlasting empires   every problem turns into a domestic issue which should be handled  very differently from international ones because the outside world  no longer provides a counterweight  and as challenges grow more  diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base   internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent  a deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the  values that made the united states great kings and tyrants generically have followed the same power politics garner popular support by keeping potential oligarchs down  in other traditions  a king is a legitimate tyrant  and a tyrant an illegitimate king  in the us  id hope that we  like samuel  wouldnt naturally make such fine distinctions

2549,0,   maybe  i batch messages using fetchmail dont ask why  and adding   4 seconds per message for a batch of 50 not untypical feels like a   real wait to me   yeesh  sounds like what you need is something to kick up once and score  an entire mailbox   wait a second  so thats why you wanted u   if you can spare the memory  you might get better performance in this  case using the pickle store  since it only has to go to disk once but  boy  does it ever go to disk  i cant think of anything obvious to  speed things up once its all loaded into memory  though  thats  profiler territory  and profiling is exactly the kind of optimization  i just said i wasnt going to do  we could have a server mode someone described this as an sa option guido van rossum home page httpwwwpythonorgguido

2551,0, i attended the same conference  and was impressed by a few systems that jim didnt mention in terms of cms  the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems  midgard  httpwwwmidgardprojectorg   a phpbased content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full cms  redhat ccm cms  javabased httpwwwexamplecomsoftwareccmcms  opencms  javabased httpwwwopencmsorg there was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength  but both plone and xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation i was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on xml some took for granted that xslt was relevant to content management  others took it just as for granted that xslt was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore xml almost completely i attended realizing that content management is generally used to apply to web content management  but i was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was almost no consideration of the potential printpdf dimension to content other than the occasional and you can use fop to make pdf as if that was functional this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management  and probably makes xml easier to ignore if html is the beall and endall of the output the honesty was refreshing  phil suh complained about the state of current tools both open source and commercial  and i wish id written down what he said  something like it sucks so extremely  it sucks so widely  and it is so generally sucking  that it seems sometimes there is no hope for a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial big boys were really much more functional than open source  until someone pointed out  ok  take some average blog software  spend 500 000 on the rollout itll scale pretty well another quote citing brendan quinn content management problems are either trivial or impossible mac os x is getting popular  of the laptops there it was an even 13 each of mac  linux  windows i am sure it wasnt news to jim  but i cant wait to try subversion  a cvs replacement that supports some of the newer features of webdav httpsubversiontigrisorg im also eager to try xopus  i hope the developers make it back home safely  they said theyd only been in america four days but were already homeless max
