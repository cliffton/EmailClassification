17,0,  this sheet is as complete as possible  and i am worried about it due to the following circumstances 1  the dispatch sheet that comes to real time was 25 mw flat on sunday and llh on monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today 2  the four corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 515 and 542  from 10 mw long to flat i tried to resolve the four corners schedules with psco  who told me they did not have a purchase from epe in july  i tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to enron each time lisa had a buy resale with pnm at four corners  but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that i saw in the dispatch sheet  i spoke with pete  who assured me that the sale to psco was good for the summer 3  i still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew  and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule  no epe representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules  and i was referred by a dispatch person to call on saturday and speak to carlos when he came in at 4 pm  i was very uncomfortable doing this  and so in my desperation called roger at home  who after some discussion with steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat sunday and llh monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on july 3  i trust his assesment  and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet between all of the preschedulers today at enron  we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the epe schedules today the sheet is as complete as i possibly can find justification for cara semperger west power scheduling 5034643814

39,0, hey guys we have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north right now sierra pacific will only let us schedule 12mw on the tie so do not try to schedule any more the tie is only good for 17mw  either do a export from sp15 to silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at silverpeakfrom pv or fc  buy transmission from spp from  wwwswoasiscom  control to hilltop 690 onpeak  390 offpeak  buy transmission from pac from mal2 to mal5 584  buy transmission from bpa from hilltop to snoho or another sink account numbers below we need to bounce this of snoho before we send it back in at malin this schedule needs to be tagged or sierra pacific gets very pissed off  they are not used to doing to much real time there is a template for this schedule so it should not be hard call and confirm the request with both pac and sierra also do not sell to a marketerespecially powerex without sleeving we do not want anybody else to know about the path if powerex sees this i guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition right now the only person using the tie is socal edison and they are flowing 12mw into cali  going the opposite way of us way it is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can if you have any questions over the weekend call me account numbers spp  pac 853724 sppsnoho 853703 spppuget 853725 geir

41,0, group we have 10 mw of length from sierra through the apx light load at 185  stan purchased this np15 length from the apx and it should be scheduled da by jeremy  there should be a ectrt load zone in pge3 with this length  use whatever opportunities are out there dynegy across cob or a straight export to maximize this position  the deal numbers are 581335purchase from apx and 581356desk to desk deal  please make sure this gets taken care of cheers jesse 
42,0, just a reminder that when entering a wheel  the interchange id must be the same for the import and export  when the import is labeled as epmiciso and the export as cisoepmi  the iso views these as unique imports and exports  they will not be linked together for a wheel  thus causing ancillary services charges to occur thank you

44,0, hey guys we have a new way to export from np15 up to the northwest cascade is a tie between ciso and pac system on the california oregon border there is currently 30mw nonfirm hourly transmission available on the tie the capacity constraint is on the pacificorp side of the tie   and you can find the real number available on the pac oasis site check under transmission requests offerings the path name you need to check is wppwcragpacw make sure you pick hourly nonfirm on the ciso side the tie point is called cascad1cragvw by the ciso procedure export at cascade from the ciso buy pac transmission from crag to bpat or whoever is picking it up from pac system transmission costthrough pac is only 584 i know the np15midc spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past it does on the other hand give us another option geir

47,0, hey guys i had a long talk with ncpa today and set up so that we again can do the zp26np15 buyresale on a realtime basis we are not doing a profit split this time  we are paying them 25mw instead this basically enables us to shift 21mw across path15 and not be subject to congestion as ncpa has grandfather rights across the path this is a sweet strategy when the sp15np15 spread is there and path15 is congested ncpas capacity is 21mw  but i would not recommend doing more than 20mw there are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it wesco especially so by doing only  20mw we do not remind them of ncpa the way this works is that we call ncpa and ask their capacity across path15 and tell them you want to schedule the br through whatever hour in caps we sell to ncpa in zp26 we buy from ncpa in np15 we can buy sp15 to fill our zp26 sale we just shift the load from sp15 to zp26  so enter a epmi calpool pge is ncpas sc  so if you are not passing phase two give them a call ncpas tel 916 7863520 pge tel  415 9731969 if you guys have any questions  just ask me geir

1463,0, to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron americas velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital  we have decided to create a capital book the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas  with any form of capital requirement  are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets therefore  on any assets currently held within each business area  the capital charge will remain at 15 internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 across the board charge transactions which are structured off balance sheet  but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron americas overall credit capacity on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books  the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction  similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction as noted above  the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost by sending marketbased capital pricing signals internally  enron americas sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to joe deffner8537117 alan quaintance3457731

1565,0, dear traders  here are a couple of things ive thought of that will make it easier for me to research deals when there is a dispute  please discuss whatever necessary with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research 1 all notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them  notebooks with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders interpretation 2 can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times  i often find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason 3 one thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the inc sheets  however  i still sometimes find that the traders notes and the inc sheets or the el paso model dont match  at that point  i dont know which one to go by  i need to be sure that i can trust the accuracy of the inc sheets as the endall 4 please make sure that all realtime deals or realtime extended deals are getting routed  ive come across a number of deals that are not routed and this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate  it also makes it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes 5 please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled  ive seen a few deals that are in the traders notebooks  but that havent been entered in enpower  you know the result 6 cuts need i say more are a mess  i really really need to see notes on every cut  this means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes database and notes in deal scheduling  when a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut  i need to see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note  many of my dmss could have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in enpower this means i found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to record this in enpower  i specifically need to see the following for every cut schedule  where did resupply come from deal  too  was it a bookout deal  too  whats the resupply price  who at the counterparty did our trader talk to  what is the reason for the cut  and please initial your notes so that if i have a question about them  i know who to ask you can never make too many notes one thing to remember is that deal entry  deal scheduling  and lotus notes do not communicate with each other  so though it is a grueling task  every transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least 2 places  its called copy and paste if we can keep these things in mind  i think we will have fewer disputes in the future  and when we do have disputes  ill be able to figure them out in a more timely manner thanks for your attention to these things  i look forward to bugging you less in the future virginia

1592,0, everyone  this is hot news showing that the caisocdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought  i am not sure how to best use this information  but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and fercs attention 1  according to two sources  the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwrs excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caisos supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff  the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caisos surreptitious transactions 2  this sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff  which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first  caiso tariff  dispatch protocol section 862 d  only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy  bids  can the caiso buy out of market oom energy  if the caiso were following the tariff  cdwrs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as 000  therefore  under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs  but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwr 3  by ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power  the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market  low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices  the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as 000  therefore  the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment  its energy would be treated as excess energy  and it would get little or nothing for it 4  while there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first  this behavior clearly benefits davis  absent the caisos purchases of cdwrs excess energy  cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  the media has been been making hay out of daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  therefore  davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts  of course  they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caiso 5  the costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who  frequently seeing 10minute ex post prices of 000  expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to 000  these scs are in for a big surprise  according to one source at sierra pacific  the caiso charged him as much as 400mwh for imbalance energy  where is the price mitigation here 6  who benefits under this scam  davis and cdwr  who loses under this scam  instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy 7  sources  our client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito  an industry insider publication mentioned it also 8  here is the quote from the friday burrito there is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls  thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me  the iso will be billing some drwcers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of  say  15  but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual realtime settlement price there is no way to estimate what the oom charge was as the iso doesnt post that information the implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price this sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the fercs goals of creating open  transparent markets 9  here is the email from our caiso representative original message from almeida  keoni mailtokalmeidacaisocom sent thursday  august 23  2001 404 pm to emmert  caroline oneil

this newsletter  i have seen them in the past harvey hall used to get it and sent a couple to me  but i havent seen it for a long time also  to recap our telephone discussion  the charges assessed to the market in charge type 487 are determined by cers  and are being collected by the iso on behalf of cers  to cover the cost of contracts that cers has signed for energy purchases and 487

sentthursday  august 23  2001 342 pm tohall  steve c legal ccdlportland volume mgmt subject487 revelation steve  here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the caiso is handling 487  kent at sierra power inquired to me why he was being charged 487  487 is the charge code the caiso uses when it has to go out of market  and purchase power that exceeds 15000mwh  481 is the charge code they use to credit it back  for the same hours and intervals that both the inc and dec prices were zero  this was obviously very peculiar and nobody in vm knew the answer so caroline posed the question to keoni at the caiso  his response was this  that the caiso is charging 487 regardless of the inc and dec prices  to cover the forward market contracts signed by cdwr and cers  in effect  they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price  and are in effect trying to recover costs for cdwr and cers kit

1595,0, to all  as per todays 6601 conversation with keoni almeida enrons customer rep at the caiso the caiso has been directed by their board to post only the market clearing prices  what this means is the following during normal operating periods the market clearing price may be the true cost of energy in the iso  the component that could be missing is the cost and volume of the out of market calls  if any  but theres no way to know  since this information is not posted during any stage 13 market mitigation procedures  the market clearing price is the highest proxy price of the least efficient unit selected under the mitigation procedures the iso is setting the emission credit value to zero and the proxy has never included gas transportation costs  the proxy mcp is not really a measure of marginal cost  further the proxy mcp excludes the cost and volumes of the out of market calls and any accepted payasbid costs and volumes to find the mcp proxy price during stage 13 the following link httpwwwcaisocommarketopsoasispubmkt2html button number 17 the impacts of the lack of this information include  but are not limited to  our knowing what the realtime cost of going short as a scheduling coordinator would be or the actual cost of congestion  not having access to the complete pricing picture hampers the ability of the realtime traders in the west from making the best business decisions possible since it has been articulated by kenoi that the caiso board has made a conscious decision not to post a complete picture of the costs of energy from hour to hour it would seem that it would be appropriate for enron to consider making an attempt to persuade the iso to reconsider its decision and that it would be of significant benefit to the market and the iso to publish all pertinent pricing data do you agree  if yes  how do we proceed  if no  why not thanks  dave

1613,0, energy exchange program neutrality adjustment charge type 1487 sc settlement contacts background as you may know  the energy exchange program began on trade date 11142000  in this program the iso obtained needed energy in the real time market and  rather than paying for the energy as a purchase  later returned the energy in another period  this was not necessarily a oneforone exchange  the incoming energy created a positive neutrality adjustment and when the energy was returned  a negative neutrality adjustment ensued  since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually valued differently  there was a cost shift associated with the transaction that was not cash neutral to the iso the iso created charge type 1487 for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market during the incoming schedules notification the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance  the incurred costs will be calculated and allocated to the scs based on their total negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming schedules took place  this new charge type will appear beginning on the june 30  2001 statements which will be published on august 23  2001  in addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december  2000 and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the rerun data ct 1487 is a semi automated charge  meaning that the collection of energy data is automated  but it will be a manual charge type within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your settlement system  note that this charge will not appear on every statement  but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance if you have any questions  please contact your client relations account manager client relations communication crcommunicationscaisocom

1616,0, this article appears to be addressing the letter sent by steve hall  via the iep  to the caiso  its good reading kit published thursday  august 16  2001 group questions power payments power crisis by mike taugher contra costa times  an industry trade group asked market officials on wednesday why they have failed to pay more than 1 billion for power sold during april and may for some reason  the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators  said jan smutnyjones  director of the independent energy producers association our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding part of the answer  officials said  is that the states powerbuying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash compounding the problem is the fact that when the may bills began coming due earlier this month  some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full  according to the independent system operator that left the iso less able to pay its may bills  said iso president and ceo terry winter in a written statement the iso acknowledges that past debt is due  winter said in the statement winter said the iso would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by friday but in response to the iep letter  he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills the iso runs the spot markets in california buyers and sellers make their bids through the iso  which sets the market price based on those bids  collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers the issue came to a head wednesday when the iep sent a letter to the iso  demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in april and may smutnyjones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around 12 billion in early april  federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the iso market that forced the state department of water resources  which began buying electricity in january  to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities customers dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them we havent been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what were going to be paid for  hidalgo said we are working with the iso to see how we can get some of that information that were not getting iso spokesman gregg fishman said his agency is working with the water department  but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential we cant tell one market participant what another market participant is doing  fishman said  original message from hall  steve c sent tuesday  august 14  2001 355 pm to belden  tim yoder  christian oneil  murray p foster  chris h williams iii  bill stokley  chris blair  kit subject fw letter sent to the iso on creditworthiness iep decided to send our letter to the iso inquiring about the creditworthiness of certain scs  like cdwr  lets see what happens steve original message from mara  susan sent tuesday  august 14  2001 232 pm to hall  steve c subject fw letter sent to the iso on creditworthiness original message from katie kaplan mailtokaplaniepacom sent tuesday  august 14  2001 1111 am to alan comnes email bill woods email bob ellery email brian t cragg email carolyn a baker email curtis hatton email curtis kebler email parquet  david dean nistetter douglas kerner email duane nelsen email ed wheless eric eisenman email george vaughn email greg blue email jack pigott email joann van buren joe ronan email john g larrea email ken hoffman email kent palmerton email fillinger  mark mark j smith email marty mcfadden email nam nguyen email rachel king randall j hickok email roger pelote email ross ain email scott sadler email steve ponder email steve schleimer email susan j mara email tom hartman email ward scobee email william hall email cc andy brown email carol hudson email jan smutnyjones email jean munoz email katie kaplan email sandra moseley email steven kelly email thomas r mcmorrow email subject letter sent to the iso on creditworthiness greetings attached please find the final letter sent to the iso on creditworthiness thank you to all who provided input and feedback on the letter thanks  katie kaplan manager of state policy affairs independent energy producers association 916 4489499

1662,0, bill  following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report as i understand  dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager  which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run forward obs included  but in the meantime these are the problems weve seen thanks so much for your help on this 1 report not reading two identical strips  when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours  same volume  same price and same counterparty using the same deal number  the report only reads one strip for example  on 8601  deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 712 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 1322 the report read all 50 mw he 712  but only 25 mw he 1322 i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw another example  on 8401  deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 2122 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each again  the report read only one of these  and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours due to the nature of real time deal entry  high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling  it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price so im hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms please let me know if this is feasible 2 report not reading sales at the bc border  this is a new one that cropped up this morning we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar  wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there for some reason  although all three deals 724366724368724367 appear in deal entry and scheduling  the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report after looking into this  ive found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report im wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border  although i dont recall seeing this problem before again  please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed i look forward to our next conference call thanks  kate symes real time trading support 5034643939

1664,0, an interesting anecdote about your good friend gray this man  in his official capacity  has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests  south asserted hes a pure political phony the state renewed ethics attacks put davis on the defensive  politics the governors conflictofinterest problems with his energy advisors give gop rival bill jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign by mark z barabak  times political writer in 1998  when gray davis first ran for governor  his republican rival tested a series of attacks on davis ethical conduct there were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign  accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding davis voracious fundraising activities but when voters heard the allegations  they simply shrugged them off the response was  hes a politician of course he does stuff like that  recalled one gop strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for republican nominee dan lungren the campaign shelved its line of attack and democrat davis romped to a landslide victory now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses  this time surrounding the states electricity crisis the issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the states power crunch appears to have finally eased the charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of bill jones  the republican secretary of state and davis sole declared rival in the race for governor last week  jones called the conflictofinterest allegations one of the most significant  pervasive and costly ethics scandals in california history but as yet  there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of davis energy advisors  let alone the governor himself and unless there is some proof  many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governors reelection prospects in november 2002 i dont see this becoming a dominant campaign issue  said jim knox  executive director of california common cause  the good government group and one of davis most prominent critics its likely that the more resonant issue    is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolved that said  knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in lungrens focus group interviews the danger is that this could undermine the publics confidence in state governments ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest  knox said it does surprise me that the governors office  with all of its experience and talent  could so cavalierly disregard the states conflictofinterest laws  which  to me  appears to be what happened the controversy involves nearly a dozen davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in california their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statementsrevelations that resulted  in part  from jones pressure five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations garry south  the governors chief political strategist  points to the firings as evidence of davis probity clearly  if the governors office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there  they would not have been fired  south said as for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry  there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governors staffor anyone in state governmentowning stock in any company whatsoever  south said even so  davis top spokesman  steve maviglio  earlier this month sold his 300 shares of stock in a california power company after news of his holdings surfaced maviglio said he lost 1 300 in the transaction at the least  the revelations have been a distraction for davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackoutfree summer it is a mistake that didnt need to be made and shouldnt have been made  said gale kaufman  a sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor the fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didnt need republicans  of course  see a larger problem hes either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration  said rob stutzman  a spokesman for the california republican party and we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for him in characteristically pugnacious fashion  the davis campaign has sought to turn jones charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gain this man  in his official capacity  has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests  south asserted hes a pure political phony but jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the states chief elections officer for the governors office to say that i dont have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldnt be able to speak to it is patently false  jones said new life for jones campaign whatever his stake  there is no question that the attention has given life to jones campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bid the 960 000 in contributions that jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by california standards  and the bush white house has all but formally endorsed rival richard riordan  who is still exploring the race fellow republican william e simon jr  a los angeles investment banker  has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacy but ironically  for all jones efforts  it may be riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy unlike simon  a political neophyte  and jones  an 18year officeholder  riordan had a decadeslong business career before serving two terms as los angeles mayor hes cut from a different cloth  said don sipple  a gop strategist who is neutral in the governors race if this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game  riordan can point to the fact he didnt start public service until he was more than 60 years old but even while insisting that davis did nothing wrong  strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governors professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment and davis best defense  they argue  is his famously modest lifestylea frugality symbolized during his 1998 campaign by his cramped west hollywood home if anyone thinks davis has used his office to get rich  one advisor said  all wife sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo

1680,0, the appearance of ferc commissioners before the senate governmental affairs committee the wednesday after next is probably driving the timing of the fercs meeting next monday at which they will consider ca matters  it is possible that ferc is trying to fashion a silver bullet to use at the senate hearing  the article below also discusses feinsteins allegations of undue influence at ferc  ray lieberman summons ferc members for hearing gas daily  june 8  2001 taking a lead from democratic california sen dianne feinstein  sen joseph lieberman  dconn  said wednesday that he would haul ferc commissioners before the senate governmental affairs committee to find out if the agency has exercised proper oversight of electric rates the hearings promise to put further heat on ferc  which has thus far resisted calls to impose price caps on the california power market lieberman said he would hold a hearing on june 20 to find out whether the federal energy regulatory commission has been properly executing its duties to provide fair and reasonable electric rates the call for hearings was liebermans first move upon becoming head of the committee in the immediate future  i hope to focus the committees oversight and investigate duties on an examination of high energy prices and what can be done to lower them  lieberman said that agenda should cheer californias senate delegation and california gov gray davis  who have accused ferc of dereliction of duty when it comes to monitoring the states energy markets liebermans announcement  in fact  comes in direct response to a plea from feinstein to launch an investigation into fercs relationship with the industry it is charged with monitoring in a letter to lieberman following the recent senate power shift  feinstein hinted at the undue influence that the energy industry exercises over the commission ferc  said feinstein  has failed to fulfill its legally mandated function under the federal power act to restore just and reasonable electricity rates gd 531 feinsteins concerns were prompted in part by a new york times report that enron chairman kenneth lay had attempted to lobby ferc for increased retail competition and access to transmission lines according to the newspaper  lay offered ferc chairman curt hebert a titfortat deal in which hebert would help expedite retail competition in exchange for political support hebert reportedly refused the deal  and lay disputed heberts account of the conversation a pbs news special coproduced by the times may further help bolster public perceptions that the industry is unreasonably close to ferc  however according to the program  which aired tuesday  ferc did not move ahead with an investigation of alleged manipulation of the california natural gas market until after the times made certain confidential documents public ferc sent the case to an administrative law judge on march 28  one day after a story ran in the times on the controversy surrounding el paso natural gas leasing of capacity to affiliate el paso merchant energy gd 429 prior to that  coverage of the story had been limited largely to the trade press establishing that ferc has indeed failed to follow federal guidelines for just and reasonable rates may prove difficult  however at a recent meeting of the energy bar association in washington  dc  douglas smith  former general counsel with ferc  noted the difficulty in finding criteria for establishing just and reasonable rates no statute  he said  spells out the terms precisely gd 427 nh

1698,0, over the past few weeks the real time desk has had several cuts on schedule s that have involved mirant in the southwest  i thought that i should brin g it to all of your attention that mirant has not been fulfilling their obl igation to resupply cut schedules in several instances mirant is also  no t telling any of the downstream counter parties until after the hour of the cut  this evening  steve and i had four separate schedules in which miran t was cut by pac transmission for several hours  in each of these cases mi rant was unwilling to resupply and was unwilling to contact the downstream counter parties  it appears to me that they dont want to take the time t o resupply or are simply not competent enough to fill the schedules  on t hree of these schedules i had to negotiate a book out for mirant and on one i was able to resupply  in all of the recent cuts i have dealt with them on they have acted in a similar manner  after discussing this issue with  cara  she thought it would be prudent to pass this information along to all of you  if you have any further questions about this issue please feel fr ee to contact me

1712,0, cara  first of all  thanks for your input regarding the new issues with path confirmation  most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily  vish is already working on them concerning the colors  there are three sets of colors representing market  supply and transmission  i have asked vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking  this information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application regarding preschedule  adding print capability to the error log should be no problem  also  adding check for errors functionality will be done concerning capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points i believe this is raised when there are multiple strips either term or schedule for a deal  but the strips have different delivery points  the routing process is not able to determine which strips to use  i will confirm this we have already changed path confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name  i may have both the code and description displayed  i believe corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records corry  can you confirm this the information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days  but if you have more  please send it thanks  will original message from semperger  cara sentfriday  july 13  2001 421 pm toatta  asem smith  will ccbentley  corry poston  david williams iii  bill subjectcontinuing testing of preschedule workspace  path confirmation and path cut software i am working in the target date of june 20th  today i added schedules from palo verde and the entire midc sheet to the testing group once cob is added  we will have pretty much an average daily volume here is my attached worksheet for mid c     file midcjune20psc  in preschedule workspace i added palo verde to the group of deals imported  and ran a total of 37 lines into the path confirmation the rest of the sheet was all bookouts  and so i marked them for routing only  i do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation this will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for real time and settlements i would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up  as the lists can be long  and i have to make notes on what is wrong also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time  we currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths this would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet  instead of cleaning up afterwards routing functionality question  if we change a delivery point in scheduling bpa nw delivered gets moved and changed every day  do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point  these types of deals route now  i would like to duplicate that existing functionality i did get an error message on those lines  capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points please see the attached sheet  there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86  but it is all deals that are our bpa northwest delivered the routing speed is excellent one second per line or less all the way in portland on local enpower the megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging my palo data was corrupted  so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points my plan is to attack the alias stuff from a different angle we are going to work with the team that sets the enpower short name to something that is workable  i would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that enpower short name in path confirmation the early sorting looks good  things look very versatile and useable yesterday i identified several problems 1 the entire path needs to be shown in both counterparty paths currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp 2 the alias list is not functioning properly  the enpower long name needs to be shown in the collapsed counterparty view  along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp 3 confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch  not pulling up each deal line by line today  i am finding the following 1  when a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view   the system blows away the schedule term and the delivery point  these fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur 2i am not allowed to sort by global id   even though global ids are populated there my idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section  no globals go in another section  and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys 3 pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes  this is to long to be practical in production for real time i would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less 4  all paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked  even though none have been cut yet 5 the grey on grey color scheme is not going to work  but that is a little thing lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable variations of the beige color are easier to read 6 the path cut button and dialog boxes i think are going to need alot of work  it looks like i will have to do all the enpower work first  and then populate the cut this is a bit different than we discussed  my plan is to take this as far as i can  and then hand it over to bill williams iii and his group for final tweaking 7 i also cannot sort by tag number  we need that thank you all for your work on this  it is really looking good i have to schedule on monday  but will jump right back in when i am finished with daily tasks cara

matches httpwwwnegotiationskillscomqahtml number 17  august 2001 negotiation in emotional circumstances our websites advice section gets questions on a wide variety of topics from all over the world  recently a web visitor posed a question that many of us face often as our own children are establishing themselves as adults  were faced with issues relating to care for older relatives heres our readers question and our response convincing elders to accept care question as a hospitalgeriatric social worker  both in my personal and work life i am frequently asked the following question  my elderly parent  aunt  neighbor clearly needs some help at home  but refuses this help even if free  or done by a family member  a church  how can i convince this person to accept help after ive determined that the issue isnt financial usually a solvable problem  then i am frequently at a loss  the situations ive seen like this seem to only resolve after a crisis occurs  and the person has no choice how would you approach a situation like this  the issues seem to revolve around pride  retaining control  denial of illness  aging or disability  any thoughts response in his notes from the underground  dostoevsky wrote  human behavior is motivated by the craving for absolute freedom and selfassertion in defiance of all dictates of reason  as decrepitude takes its toll on our bodies  and minds  often pride is the only thing we have left waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to organizing care for people who have less and less capacity to take care of themselves or their personal surroundings probably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot of questions  using the example of children of an elderly parent  first the concerned children need to ask themselves what are their own interests  do they want to assuage guilt  do they fear that harm will come to their parent  are they concerned that a crisis will interrupt the normal course of their own lives questions also need to be asked of the parent what most concerns you about your situation  health  comfortable surroundings  companionship  your capacity to hold your head up and say  daughter please i can do it myself  one can also ask  what do you think are the standards that determine ones capacity to live an independent life this questioning approach brings the parties into fuller participation in the decisionmaking process when i ask you a question it means i am taking you seriously the reverse is equally true  in negotiation  this technique is called active listening the crucial element is listening closely to all the elements of the responses to those questions  both the questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of other people  it is no less important to respond to what people say by checking to make sure youve understood their points you may want to say  this is what i understood you to have said is my understanding correct  you also want to indicate  the fact that i understand what you have said does not necessarily mean i agree with you clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is a critical vital sign  the fear of loving relatives that something bad can happen has to be balanced against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their selfesteem  you are attacking a most vulnerable part of their anatomy  you cannot negotiate away a persons selfesteem  but you can destroy it through frontal and flanking attacks the frustration faced by folks who see loved ones failing to take proper care of themselves is phenomenal  very often the people who have advocated professional care ultimately must mutter hopefully to themselves the unsatisfying statement  i told you so in your question you indicate that crisis forces choice  perhaps the best approach is to prepare a safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs  it cannot prevent a crisis from happening and it is crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by forcing the victim of it to lose face but having that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of the fall relationship is one of the seven most significant issues to consider in negotiation  focusing on the relationship with an elderly parent or friend  not letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring can make it much easier when someones selfesteem is attacked by a crisis  looking at oneself and saying  its not my fault  is not a way of avoiding blame  but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their own mistakes  just as they did the first time they

1769,0, commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference  the chie f judge  in his down home manner  did not miss the opportunity to say that  you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink  below is a c liff notes version of the judges report and recommendation issued at 449  pm today  attached is the complete work 20 the judge opined that very large refunds would be due while the amount of such refunds is not 89 billion as claimed by the state of california  th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars  probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum  at the same time  while there are vast su ms due for overcharges  there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the caiso  the investor owned utilities  and the state of california  can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller   the chief judge thinks not  another notable quote  it is the opinio n of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated 20 the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5  which wa s summarily rejected by the state of california  and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also  rejected20 20 refund effective date refund effective date of october 2  2000  for sales  in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px  the chief judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date  spot market sales are sales that a re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery20 evidentiary hearing the differences between what the state of california  believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what  the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds  involve factual disputes  thus  the chief judge recommends that a trialty pe  evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to  the methodology set forth below  because of the urgent need for an answer  to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60day fast track schedule   it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding  however  such a methodology may not be  appropriate for all sellers in the caisos and cal pxs spot markets in an  afterthefact refund calculation    in any event  sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund  period methodology the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he june 19th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order  to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the cais os and cal pxs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period o ctober 2  2000 through may 28  2001 20 heat rate the actual heat rates  rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the june 19th order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit gas cost  the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based  upon a daily spot gas price  in the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in np15 north of path 15  the daily spot gas price for pge citygate a nd malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the  marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour  if  the marginal unit is located in sp15 south of path 15  the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour   the daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in fina ncial times energys gas daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points  the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the  refund price for the days that gas daily is not published weekends and hol idays20 om adder  an adder of 6mwh for om should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price 20 emissions costs demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation credit adder the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after january 5  2001 when pge  and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy ancillary services  consistent with the june 19th order  ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market  adjustment bids would also be treated the  same as set forth in the june 19th order20 maximum price for nonemergency hours somewhat unclear  the chief judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds  the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 nonemergen cy requirement of the june 19th order  to measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price  every hour should be recalculated  offsets  recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all char ges for the refund period  amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated  any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period interest  interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

1776,0, please make a note of the following i know we have several new traders  and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process but this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job thanks 1 purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book pay attention when extending deals if you dont purchase the energy in a particular book  you dont have energy to sell from that book 2 specify epec as the group when entering deals for el paso also  pay attention to detail with epe spinning reserves as a violation is extremely expensive for epe  also curtail units in the right order copper then newman 4 then four corners be sure to curtail four corners before selling under cost 3 el paso model must tie out with carp when trading day is done check spreadsheet formulas print a copy of the model and attach it to the carp before filing 4 el paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model melectricepeepe01aug01epe reconciliation model and all variances explained 5 bloomberg deals need to be assigned a 15 flat broker fee per trade if you begin a deal with bloomberg trades  enter a permegawatt fee  and extend the deal later with bilateral trades  youre effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because that fee will be assigned to every mw in your deal 6 most importantly  if you are not sure  call someone who is thanks again for your attention to these matters kate

1784,0, mike mcdonald and i met with wapa and the bureau of reclamation on tuesday 717 and learned some interesting information about their relationship with pge  on oct 28th pge filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with wapa  currently pge looks at the imbalance energy positive or negative at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party  the imbalance account is calculated by aggregating mwhrs for the entire month  as a result  wapa would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out as of oct 28th all this changes  wapa has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to pge imbalance prices which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices  i believe this means that wapa is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets  we probably need to gear up our relationship with the appropriate people over there to make sure that we are on their phone list stewart

1830,0, energy exchange program neutrality adjustment charge type 1487 sc settlement contacts background as you may know  the energy exchange program began on trade date 11142000  in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for the real time market and  rather that paying for the energy as a purchase  later returned the energy in another period  this was not necessarily a oneforone exchange  the incoming energy created a positive neutrality adjustment and when the energy was returned  a negative neutrality adjustment ensued  since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually valued differently  there was a cost shift associated with the transaction that was not cash neutral to the iso the iso created charge type 1487 was developed for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market during the incoming schedules notification the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance  the incurred costs will be calculated and allocated to the scs based on their total negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming schedules took place  this new charge type will appear beginning on the june 30  2001 statements which will be published on august 23  2001  in addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december  2000 and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the rerun data ct 1487 is a semi automated charge  meaning that the collection of energy data is automated  but it will be a manual charge type within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your settlement system  note that this charge will not appear on every statement  but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance if you have any questions  please contact your client relations account manager client relations communication crcommunicationscaisocom

1843,0, names of the 5 people fired disclosed below 5 state energy advisors fired over conflicts ethics the consultants were involved in buying electricity for california from a generator whose stock they owned  setting up a clash of official duties  personal interests jeffrey l rabin daryl kelley rich connell times staff writers 07282001 los angeles times home edition a1 copyright 2001  the times mirror company the davis administration  stung by charges of excessive secrecy  disclosed late friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances a sixth consultant hired to help california purchase electricity has quit  according to state records all were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned in addition  the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled top advisors to gov gray davis told the times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week  after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements a review of those documents  which included stock holdings  showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line  said the governors senior advisor  nancy mcfadden state law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence  the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings among them are two wall street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan  which includes the largest state bond sale in us history the new york firms that employ executives joseph fichera and michael hoffman have been paid 275 000 a month to  among other things  help pitch the 125billion bond issue to wall street analysts and state lawmakers the companies stand to make an additional 14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines davis contends that fichera  hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor  beyond the reach of the states political reform laws critics question the distinction the governors approach may be convenient for him  said jim knox  executive director of the watchdog group california common cause  but it ignores the law disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest  knox said trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing the firings disclosed friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year more than 25 million is being spent by the state on consultants  according to state records in the process  seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws it took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances  including investments the state political reform act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far  the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted most of the consultants  for example  failed to state when they bought the energy stocks one of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is secretary of state bill jones  a republican who hopes to challenge davis next year jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws this week jones called for a federal securities and exchange commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants 4 traders owned shares of calpine the four traders removed this week all owned shares of calpine corp  a san josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the 43 billion in longterm state power contracts their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than 100 000  records show while working for the state department of water resources  officials said they bought undetermined amounts of calpine power on the states behalf more than 14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by calpine in the first quarter of this year  according to the most recent records available we did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks  the governors legal affairs secretary  barry goode  said in an interview the highestranking consultant removed  richard ferreira  was hired on a 500 000 contract in january to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts  records show a former assistant general manager with the sacramento municipal utility district  ferreira was paid 200 an hour by the state after he disclosed owning as much as 10 000 in calpine stock  officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts ferreira could not be reached for comment the governors office identified the other four as traders william f mead  herman leung  constantine louie and peggy cheng  most of whom could not be reached friday by the times all of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the power exchange  a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of californias electricity deregulation hired by the state in february and march  the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between 15 000 and 21 000 a month  including living expenses in sacramento and flights home to southern california mead  55  a former edison engineer  said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago he said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 12 years ago for 12 000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times  doubling in value each time mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team thursday and fired i asked very directly  is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer  mead said he just said your services are terminated i came up here  away from home  living in a hotel room  trying to keep the lights on  trying to get the state through a crisis and now i get a finger pointed at me as if im some sort of criminal i guess its just politics and were the pawns administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders  including one who bought calpine stock just before beginning work for the state that trader  elaine griffin  who also came from the power exchange  left the state power buying operation july 14  three days after disclosing her energy industry investment griffin  who the governors office said had obtained another job  could not be reached for comment griffin reported purchasing 10 000 to 100 000 of calpine stock on feb 1  in her final days working at the electricity exchange a few days later  calpine signed and announced a 46billion  10year deal to sell power to the department of water resources on feb 20  griffin joined the state power buying agency  just as the state and calpine were finalizing an additional 83 billion in power contracts one of those  a 20year deal signed feb 27  was the longest the state has awarded calpine about 13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years in addition to the state consultants who bought calpine stock  two others reported owning stock in texasbased power marketing giant enron corp and two more bought stock in southern california edison  the faltering utility that davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy another consultant bought stock in reliant energy of houston  a large power plant operator that bought several california plants from utilities after deregulation bernard barretto  an energy trader  who buys energy on the daily spot market  said in an interview that he bought about 2 000 in enron stock shortly before he began work for the state feb 28 purchase of enron stock defended i dont see a conflict  he said at the time  we werent really dealing with enron i still havent bought from enron barretto said he never considered his enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice july 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job that notice came from goode  the governors lawyer we expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards  he wrote that standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today if he or she refuses  the state will sever its contract with that person however  the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors  fichera and hoffman davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney raquelle de la rocha  a former member of the los angeles ethics commission and the state fair political practices commission she concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors  not consultants  and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects fichera is davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale he has pitched the plan to lawmakers  reporters and the wall street financial community fichera refused to comment on the record fichera and hoffmans companies  saber partners and blackstone group  prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure  intended to pay for past and future power buying pact specifies financial advice the states contract with the fichera and hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state the decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with montague derose and associates that consulting firm was hired on a 18million contract like the other two firms  it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state that firms top advisor  douglas s montague  was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement he reported no power company interests the governors legal advisors said the difference is that montague is on a longer contract photo barry goode  above  governors legal affairs secretary copyright  2000 dow jones  company  inc all rights reserved

pointsgenerators  heres to better luck in brazil    new york dow jonesless than a month after the federal energy  regulatory  commission shot the messenger  its looking for new volunteers    on june 19  the ferc totally trashed us wholesale electricity markets  with  price controls and an order for refunds dating back to october or to may  2000 or  to whenever they later decide what is the ferc price cap on electricity  throughout the western us well  its whatever the california  independent  system operator decides it is    nevertheless  on wednesday the ferc made a sharp uturn in the direction  of  free markets for power with unquestioning confidence  it ordered all us  utilities to consolidate their transmission lines into a few independent  transmission operators in order to foster free trade and movement of  electricity    surely  some might say  the ferc didnt give the california iso total  price  discretion over the western us  did it after all  the iso is simply the  administrator of the fercs very precise formulas  like this one for  nonemergencies the cost of burning natural gas assuming a power plant  is  located both in northern california and southern california at the least  efficient generator that was called on in the most expensive hour of the  most  recent stage 1 emergency that wasnt a stage 2 at any point during the  hour   plus 6 for operation and maintenance multiplied by 085 then add 10 if  the  buyer is the california department of water resources    what could be more clear more marketbased  as the ferc trumpeted its  own  ingenuity how could the iso possibly manipulate that    the isos initial cap of 92 a megawatthour was based on a gas price of  9  after inputting the other elements  that cap turns out to be based on a  quite  efficient heat rate of 114 surely  the heat rate of the least efficient  unit  used in the most recent emergency  etc  was 20 or higher    but the iso decided it didnt want to pay more than 100mwh who  confirms  that the iso really used the correct heat rate nobody    now  after gas prices crashed to 4  the iso had full discretion  based  on a  technicality  to avoid resetting the cap at all four opportunities  the  iso  declined to reset the cap because the iso staff know they cant get the  power  california needs for 43  which is where the cap would have come out using  the  old 114 heat rate thats way below the costs of the marginal generators  needed  when things get even a little tight    sierra pacific resources srp nevada power couldnt get all the power  it  needed july 2 for 92 even    so  what is the ferc price cap on western power whatever the california  iso says it  is    not surprisingly  nevada power and others western utilities are furious  with  california for successfully using its political muscle to export its  problem to  the rest of the west    before the ferc price caps  the market definitely was working when you  had  prices of 300 a megawatthour  people were mortgaging their restaurants  to buy  a diesel generator to sell power into the grid  said chelan county public  utility districts chuck berrie  one of a handful of utility veterans in  the  us who thrived in the deregulated wholesale market unlike those of most  other  western utilities  chelans customers havent seen a rate increase and  wont for  the next five years  because berrie and his coworkers have maximized the  utilitys assets and market opportunities    people were coming out of the woodwork to get generators on line ive  never  seen anything like it but the ferc order killed them  berrie said    orders for hundreds of small dieselfired generators that could have  helped  get the west through the next 18 months or so were canceled immediately  after  the ferc order  because the generators cost more than 92mwh to operate  they  are expensive to run  but could have patched over the shortage until big   permanent power plants are finished in 2003 but who wanted to bet in late  june  that the california iso would pass up the opportunity for a 44 price cap  so  the orders were canceled    in fact  even with the cap stuck at 92  at least 100 megawatts of  installed  generators are being taken off line and sent back to the rental companies  when  the blackouts come  hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses will be  without power that the generators could have provided    the biggest manufacturer of such generators  caterpillar inc cat   said it  is redirecting the units to brazil  which like the western us is highly  dependent on hydroelectricity and brazil  like the west  is enduring a  drought  this year brazil  however  isnt under ferc jurisdiction    but surely the generators must not be needed if we are sending them down  to  poor old brazil    not so  according to utility employees like berrie  as well as the  quasigovernmental northwest power planning council the chances of  blackouts  this summer and winter is still much higher than acceptable  and  of  course   higher still without those temporary generators    price controls kill the messenger high prices say that supply should be  increased and usage reduced really high prices  like those the west has  endured  for the past year  say hurry    but the administration of george w bush  after getting a good ol  political  whuppin at the hands of california gov gray davis  agreed to shoot the  messenger    why would anybody get into this industry with all the uncertainty of  this  ridiculousness its the price caps  as well as the rebates or youre  going to  get sued regular people were practically turning over their couches to  get the  nickels together to invest in a generator  and they have lost their  investment   berrie says    i think the horse is dead even if you removed the regulations and  prices did  come back up  people still wont come back what certainty would you have  that  they wont change the rules again who can take that risk he added    yet the ferc just ordered the restructuring of many billions of dollars  of  transmission lines as the foundation of a free market    in the east  they must be wondering what that messenger said before the  ferc  shot him apparently it was brazils economy can afford to pay more for  electricity than the us economy can    by mark golden  dow jones newswires 2019384604

1880,0, to protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of californias powerbuying binge  state officials turned to a technique called sleeving they used lees old long beach firm  mieco inc  and allegheny power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer chaos inexperience hobbled power buyers state electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders by daryl kelley and jeffrey l rabin times staff writers august 12 2001 it was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis  when californias first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from bakersfield to eureka davis administration strategists were huddled in a sacramento office that january evening  trying to figure how to keep the lights on  when a speeding tractortrailer slammed into the capitol like a runaway train i looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising  said ray hart  head of the energy planning team the symbolism was not lost on him the next day  with the states electricity supply on the line and the governors political career on the blink  hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the west  purchasing electricity for 10 million customers whose utilities were going broke now  seven months and billions of dollars later  the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry even gov gray davis acknowledges the mismatch its like the yankees playing a stickball team  he said in a recent interview were totally out of our league the administrations new longterm contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future making matters worse  nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companiesa fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements five were hastily fired  and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations how an agency could forget conflictofinterest codes  or ignore them  is beyond me  said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica this is the way people lose faith in government hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in  including one from davis republican political rival  secretary of state bill jones amid all the controversy of recent days  hart said  the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed frankly  said hart  a veteran administrator with the state department of water resources  its kind of disconcerting we arent getting the credit we should be getting patching together a team on the fly the states new energybuying organization was a beg  borrow and recruit operation a core group already was working in the department of water resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the state water project the agency received an immediate infusion of 22 million to create its expanded trading arm of 88 employees and consultants on the fly  hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers  workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from pacific gas  electric  southern california edison and the energy industry many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the west to negotiate prices then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand from the start  the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day  a state budget document said it is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively professionals in this business are highly compensated power buyer william mead was among the first to get the call in early february they said  can you be up here tuesday  said mead  a 55yearold former edison engineer from duarte i said  for a job interview and they said  no  bring enough stuff for several months  they told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume  mead said he worked six weeks  he said  before he finally got a contract to sign in those early days it was chaos because we were always at stage 2  on the verge of blackouts  he said there was no focus other than to keep the lights on one day  mead said  he bought 10 of all power consumed on the states electricity grid during his 12hour shift but  unlike mead  most of the new crew had never bought power before  according to their resumes most worked at the nowdefunct california power exchange  an energy trading floor similar to a stock market  reconciling sales and purchases made by others before that  one worked at a freightforwarding company in carson and another ran china noodle house in arcadia energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group theyre just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast  said mark palmer  spokesman for houstonbased enron corp  one of the nations largest energy marketers its like someone who flies a kite one day  and then is told to go fly a 747 the next one veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings you dont just come out to someone and say  whats your price and then pay it but thats what some of them have done a senior analyst at a california firm that sells power to the state traders said  the word i get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them palmer said california  for the salaries its paying  could have done better a particular lightning rod for criticism is the 480 000  twoyear contract of chief trader susan t lee  30  who was hired in april for 120 an hour with barely a years experience in the energy industry  she leads a 16person crew that buys electricity the day before its needed or for nearly immediate use state records show that lee was paid more than 30 000 a month  including overtime  as she began her new duties that ladys got one years experience  and shes getting 500 grand  palmer said an experienced trader in private industry  he said  might make 80 000 to 120 000 in a good year  plus bonuses shes certainly making double what i am  but shes worth it  said hart  who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the onceobscure department of water resources although lee could not be reached for comment  hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of todays evolving trading market california energy deregulation began only in 1996  and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year  he said i would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody regardless of experience lees team members  meanwhile  have been signed to lucrative shortterm contracts worth a maximum of 15 000 to 21 000 a month  including housing  rental cars  per diem pay and flights home on days off state records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount one industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the power exchange he said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in january but he didnt think they were qualified some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete they know more than me theyve seen it all  said state trader bernard barretto  a navy electronics technician before he got a job at the power exchange in 1998 in their own defense  the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost our job was to buy whatever we could buy  former trader elaine griffin said california was truly a captive market hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higherups do the traders go out and start the deal yes  hart said do they cut the final deal no far from the trading trenches  the governor sees things differently the trading arms of companies such as enron far surpass that of the department of water resources  he said these are very sophisticated operations  davis said they have several meteorologists and banks of media people to protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of californias powerbuying binge  state officials turned to a technique called sleeving they used lees old long beach firm  mieco inc  and allegheny power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer the technique also allowed california to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills some traders  however  saw through the guise the volume of energy being bought on the market by mieco and allegheny was the tipoff that california had weighed in i knew it  and im pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it  too  said one trader  who like others  asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state but it worked for a while it helped keep the shortterm prices down controversy over stock holdings the state traders were powerless  however  to protect themselves just as they were settling into their new jobs  and energy prices were falling  the administration was stung by the disclosures that 11 of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks the governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firmsan josebased calpine corpin which they had owned stock the highestranking of them was former sacramento utility executive richard ferreira  who was hired on a 500 000 contract in january to negotiate longterm power contracts the four others were the veteran mead and three younger buyers herman leung  constantine louie and peggy cheng elaine griffin  who had resigned just days before the firings  also held calpine stock while trading for the state most of the traders  who had worked together at the power exchange in alhambra  said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem they said no one asked if they even held any energy shares mead said traders on his state teamsuch as cheng  leung and louiehad no ability to influence calpines stock price because their purchases of the companys electricity were infrequent and small mead said he had openly touted calpine stock to his colleagues because hed made so much money on it he said his investments of 20 000 in 1999 and 134 000 last fall brought him about 400 000 when he was ordered to sell last month you want to know how i picked calpine he said investors business daily has a system for selecting stocks  and calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential leung said he rarely dealt with calpine and bought his 2 000 worth of shares on jan 22  while still at the power exchange  which had a conflictofinterest policy barring ownership of energy stock i didnt know i would have an opportunity like this at the time  leung said of his briefly held state job i bought it just because im interested in the market all the time i follow it today  shipped back home from their rented apartments outside sacramento  the fired traders see themselves as victims of davis effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis they bristle at the fact that davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings the big boys  the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose  those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention  mead said theyre the ones who knew how things worked  times staff writer nancy vogel in sacramento contributed to this story for information about reprinting this article  go

1883,0, keoni we had another unpleasant experience with hildago last night  this is the  third different individual at epmi who has had an interaction with him resu lting in a hassle  the other day i wrote it off to my fault  but since it  has happened with 2 other people here  and only with hildago  i now believe the problem is him  he has a natural antagonistic demeanor that makes peo ple defensive and angry  when he calls he accuses us of not meeting our ob ligations and demands information and says things like  if you do not prov ide this information i will turn you in   we understand our responsibilit y to provide outage information to the iso  we are diligent in completing  outage reports and submitting them to the outage coordination desk at the i so  the iso is requiring an additional communication with the real time gr oup to either 1 confirm that the outage ended as planned  or 2 change th e outage timing if required  although  to my knowledge  this requirement i s not in the iso tariff  and has not been communicated to scs in writing in any way  and furthermore is a waste of time for everyone  will make effort s to do this  the iso should recognize  however  that in most cases  our r eal time group is not aware of outages our generator sc clients  nor should they be  as these units our off line and therefore out of play in real t ime  hildago should work to communicate better and treat people with respe ct  he clearly is not doing that with us   20 thanks chris

1897,0, sue  bill williams iii from the real time desk has asked me to contact you to see if you could ask the iso to resume publishing the as bid and out of market cost information for imbalance energy purchases  according to bills contact at the iso  keoni  the iso made the decision to publish only the proxy price  but not the accepted bids exceeding the proxy price the as bid information needs to be published so that scs can get real time price signals about imbalance energy charges  the proxy price is not enough to determine the cost of imbalance energy because the iso doesnt buy all of its energy at the proxy price  some will be purchased at the proxy price  some at bids exceeding the proxy  and some through oom calls  absent this information  scs incurring imbalance charges will not find out what their costs are for 75 days

1904,0, at enron  were good at a lot of things  making markets  commoditizing products  managing risk  offering innovative energy solutions to customers  the list goes on and on  however  one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses  were all shareholders in this company  and we need to spend our companys dollars as wisely as we spend our own there are some simple  yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure were careful with enrons money  the policy committee has approved and recommended the following professional services  this is our largest area of discretionary spending  at more than 600 million last year professional services includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms  contractors and other consulting groups  to make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units  we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with global strategic sourcing gss  effective july 1  in addition  contracts for more than 5 000 must be preapproved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and gss  for more information  see httpibuyitenroncom online expense reporting tool xms  xms  our online expense reporting tool  enables us to expedite  monitor and report expenses  effective july 1  all employees on domestic us payroll will be required to use xms for reimbursement of businessrelated expenses to access xms  go to httpxmsenroncom enterprise wide portal  we currently have 122 internal web sites across the company  the amount of technology work  marketing collateral  and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable  it makes sense to have one enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single  personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online  this new companywide portal  under the leadership of tony mends  will be launched in several phases beginning this fall another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment  enron has long had travel policies in place  as we have grown  we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated  the availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel  the following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business  any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader air travel  employees are requested to use either travel agency in the park tap or the gssapproved preferred travel agency for your location  all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by gss  or httpclicktripenroncomenron  the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts  employees who fly in the united states should book nonrefundable coach tickets  which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a 100 fee  for this reason  we strongly encourage all employees to purchase nonrefundable domestic coach tickets when possible lodging  gss has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business units individual hotel policy  we recommend that you use enrons list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business units policies  you can view the list at httptravelenroncom car rental services  when renting a car for business travel  employees should use our preferred car rental agencies  national us and canada and alamo us since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and enron through the insurance coverage in our contract  visit httptravelenroncom for details and updates to services available outside the us offsite meetings  all domesticus offsite meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through gss  which will negotiate preferred rates for enron  they can be reached at 713 6468311 because there are differences between business units and offices  each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure enron retains its competitive edge  these recommendations are some basic  sensible actions we can take companywide  but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities  if you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us  please email us at recommendationsforcostsavingsenroncom   a list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on

1914,0, hi there stranger well i havent spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and im just checkin to see that my lil buddy in portland isnt working himself too hard  as you know i tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a workout and a scrimmage soccer game  i am so sore  its out of control ok so down to the real reason im writing  brendan and i had a great time at happy hour  we talked a little about you but mostly about life in general  he had mentioned that he had emailed me so i rushed home to check it basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as odd  i guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt he had written that although you thought i was cool and whatever you had commented on how strange  the situation was and he sort of elaborated on that so the point of this email is i guess to reassure you that i only have the best intentions towards you  i am not trying to be your girlfriend or anything similar to that  to tell you the truth i dont even know what your romantic situation is  i just think you are an awesome guy whom id love to become close friends with i am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in huntington beach if you still are and im thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together  i bragged and bragged to brendan about what a great guy you were and then came home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances  i really am just a very overly affectionate and loving person not to mention spontaneous  i didnt mean to scare you away from having a great friendship with me and me with you for heavens sake you are my portland connection and im your beach bum buddy  honestly if i were a psycho i would have jumped at the chance to come up and see your condo when you offered  i just think you are someone id love to get to know  especially if you are anything like brendan which best friends usually are he is such a sweetie  when he and meg go to visit her mom in la they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are welcome to stay with me as well i guess i never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to be quite honest i didnt even think to ask brendan because its not important  i want you  bill  for your friendship and for your companionship now and when i move to portland  reflecting back i realize that i may have written or said something that caught you off guard  its just my personality  im a huge flirt  for heavens sake i was voted most flirtatious my senior year not to mention most likely to succeed probably the second one due to the first but who knows  hahaha  im only teasing ok seriously now bill  i want you to be honest  if i did locating your condo etc or said like that was the most romantic thing i had ever read that was written by a guy something to upset you or give you a false impression i am so sorry i do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter i knew your romantic stiuation  yeah i would have jumped at the chance to have dated you  but we didnt and the truth is i can never have too many friends  especially good looking ones that i can introduce to all my girl friends so that they can be jealous with envy  like i said i only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our relationship as friends  but if you are uncomfortable with something ive done or said i am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or email me and youll never hear from me again  scouts honor  i ve never been a scout but im not know for my lies either teehee i would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our realtionship as friends  if i can ill put your mind at ease if not well i enjoyed our short 30 minute interlude  as always you are still welcome to come visit me and stay with me i would love to have the company if i dont hear form you within the next couple of weeks ill assume the worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you change your mind  im lucky in the fact that i can do that sort of thing   ok just email me or call me  let me know that you are alive and kickin ill be leaving for calgary  canada this thursday morning at 6 am and will be there until the 16th  im so excited this is my first trip out of country but then again you know that  so i guess ill hear from you when i hear from you i just thought of a last possible reason i may be way off base here but i am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself  he is a real sweetheart and hes going to make a wonderful husband and father just not with me  if you are concerned about our friendship and him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and todd is secure enough in himself that he doesnt care  if this is about august and you staying with me  my father is moving me down not him and it will be a long time until he can come to visit  also when i get there we are not going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship  i havent dated or had much of a wild stage and i have told him that we will see other people  hes fine with that as well ok i admit that his potland stunt was a little irrational but hey i thought it was thoughtful and darling  i love surprises and little extras  i just didnt expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy to someone whom id never met  therefore i did everything in my power to rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this you think im a psycho  not to mention i had to face brendan and before he could read my email you had already revealed the stroy to him  so i got to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience ok thats it  take it however you will but its 1251am and im exhausted i did the best i could to figure out and fix a possibly nonexisting problem  i hope i did well enough to inspire a response from you    hope to hear or read from you soon goodnight and god bless  nikki  send a cool gift with your ecard httpwwwbluemountaincomgiftcenter

1968,0, bill  chris  i think this is the market notice you two were refering to  yes  caiso  will use the lower of scsubmitted bids or a units proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the mcp of supplemental energy and as however  my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and as  if you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your units proxy costs and are willing to justify them  you should bid your higherthanproxy costs if you are accepted  you are supposed to be paid as bid let me know if you want me to follow up with caiso or let me know if you have asked them about this  
1969,0, hey guys the iso cutting our offpeak imports from pv has been an ongoing problem now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels normally the iso will cut our import and shift our load from np15 pge123 across the path to relieve the congestion if you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be 30 cong   thus they will not cut your schedule going in at pv  instead of shifting your load the iso will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy it is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut i would recommend to put in the max number of mws you think you can buy in the north and get rid of in the desert go big in the offpeak  we submitted 200mw wheels saturday and i think its safe to do similar size most nights  geir

2008,0, federal caps didnt deter higher prices power caliso study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits by nancy vogel times staff writer july 27 2001 sacramento  after federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month  big private sellers of power in california continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap  according to a confidential study by state grid operators the analysis by the california independent system operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed june 20 caliso has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation the report is a summary of what caliso calls possible anticompetitive behavior by duke energy  williams cos  mirant corp  reliant energy and dynegy corp in a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost  said greg cook  senior policy analyst with calisos department of market analysis the state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded instead  the significance of the bids is that they show how california could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens  said frank wolak  a stanford university economist who studies the california electricity market the bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand  he said if weather all of a sudden gets really hot from southern to northern california  the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to california caliso calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants the average cost for the five was 105 per megawatthour  which closely matches the federal price limit in california  which now stands at 101 per megawatthour according to the power bidding procedures  companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price  allowing them to make a substantial profit on average  four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production but with the exception of atlantabased mirant  each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher houstonbased reliant  for example  bid as much as 540 per megawatthour  more than five times its estimated cost overall  reliants average bid was close to costs  according to the analysis caliso identified companies by code in its report sources familiar with the study identified the companies for the times the caliso report singled out supplier 5  identified by sources as charlotte  ncbased duke energy  saying the company continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs duke owns two large power plants on the central coast it marked up its bids an average of 88 beyond its cost to produce electricity  according to the analysis for example  it cost duke 85 to 121 to generate a megawatthour of electricity in the time period studied  the report shows  but the company offered to sell a megawatthour from 149 to 195 duke spokesman tom williams on thursday said  the use of the data in some cases doesnt appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under longterm contracts  and not on the spot market  which the caliso report studied  he noted reliant spokesman richard wheatley said  were looking at the data  and we question whether or not it is correct a combination of cool weather  heavy conservation  the startup of new power plants and recently signed longterm power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the states electricity crisis in recent weeks market prices that as recently as may averaged 271 per megawatthour have dropped to less than 100 per megawatthour the more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higherpriced bids but they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten  wolak said such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the federal energy regulatory commission order issued june 19  he said the bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to caliso  a folsombased agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75 of california caliso buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the states electrical freeway and avert blackouts as californias fledgling market began to go haywire last fall  caliso workers struggled to purchase as much as 30 of the states power demand with just hours to spare since then  the market has stabilized  and calisos purchases now amount to roughly 5 of the electricity california consumes related story power profits power plant operator calpine said its quarterly profit more than doubled c2 copyright 2001  los angeles times httpwwwlatimescom  comment function reporterrormsg  url  line      if false  alertmsg  selfonerror  reporterror

2021,0, you might be interested in this discussion original message from hall  steve c sentfriday  july 27  2001 916 am toperrino  dave cccomnes  alan subjectre two major inconsistencies in fercs most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders hi dave  of course the decision is politically motivated  but arent they all  its just that now its our ox being gored in general  review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential  ie  courts give agencies a lot of discretionwhich is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision  but if a court concludes that the agencys action was arbitrary and capricious it may overturn the decision  our argument would be that ferc is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregardedwithout explanationits earlier rulings in this case  its no slam dunk  but its the best argument we have  we will never win an argument in any court that ferc could have or should have crafted its order a certain way a court will almost always say  the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit  however  courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of constitutional due process as for the publics opinion of enron as a profiteerfor better or worse its already established  and no matter what action we take  davis will cast a negative spin on it  so why not fight for our interests  the stakes in this order are worth it  this recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model power marketing its hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs  the generators get to offset refunds with input costs  we should be able to use our purchased power costs  i dont see much downside for us to argue that ferc should keep its word that 1 refunds can only be ordered within 60 days  and 2 all sellers are entitled to marginal costs  we are just holding the commission to its promise  at a minimum  the commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings these are good questions  have a good weekend i

inconsistencies in fercs most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders steve  aside from the fact that the entire play by the ferc in the last 3 months has been purely politically motivated  are we going to challenge the latest rulings in court  can we challenge this apparent lack of consistency memory loss if we were to challenge do you think the general public opinion and impression of enron as a henious profiteer from houston would negate any potential gains made from making such a challenge just curious about what your thoughtsplanned recommendation are thanks for the information

memory 1in its dec 15  2000 order  ferc clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with ferc   how can ferc now say that transactions from nov 1 through april 26 are subject to refund  the dec 15 order said that only transactions that were identified by commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability  otherwise  refund potential for transactions over 150mwh would close after 60 days  presumably  liability for transactions under 150mwh would close after 60 days  too here is the excerpt from the dec 15 order we clarify that  unless the commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review  refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the commission  the institution of a 60day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff  dec 15 order at 58 2  in its nov 1 order  ferc said that it would limit refund liability to sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs  ferc now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costsmuch less opportunity coststo offset potential refunds from the nov 1 order  however  should we find it necessary to order refunds  we will limit refund liability to no lower than the sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs  nov 1 order at 39 fercs july 25 order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding  arbitrary and capricious  anyone steve alan  please forward to dan watkiss and ron carroll

2061,0, after careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers  i decided to leave copper on for friday night 818  there were several reasons for this decision including the pv outage   the fact that  newman 1 was only released for 32 megawatts  and the fact that when we needed copper last night during the pv outage they had problems bringing it up  i felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the right thing to due given those factors  if either of you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact me  thanks guz

2070,0, fired calif dwr traders had access to isos control room  updated tuesday  august 21  2001 0534 pm et by bryan lee of dow jones newswires washington dow jonesfour of the five california department of water resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operators control room that revelation was contained in a recent letter to the house government reform committee from terry winter  the california independent system operators president and chief executive the letter responded to house lawmakers concerns  voiced during an aug 2 hearing  about dwr power traders having access to the isos control room floor and the wealth of marketsensitive information available there rep doug ose  rcalif  who chairs the committees energy policy panel  said access to the isos control room allowed dwr traders to cherrypick power purchases  and led federal regulators to exclude dwr purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order the five fired dwr traders owned stock in calpine corp cpn investmentsquotessymbolcpn  news investmentsnewssymbolcpn  msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolcpn  a major power provider in california the four fired dwr employees with access to the iso control room were william mead  herman leung  constantine louie and peggy chung the fifth  richard ferreiro  wasnt among those winter listed as having controlroom access neither did elaine griffin  who resigned after it was learned she owned calpine stock they were among 14 dwr employees who had their controlroom access privileges terminated by the iso over the past two months the others had their badges deactivated because they either hadnt filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadnt been using their badges to access the iso control room  said stephanie mccorkle  an iso spokeswoman nine dwr power traders still enjoy access to the iso control room  according to winters letter to ose among them is bernard barretto  who reportedly owns stock in enron corp ene investmentsquotessymbolene  news investmentsnewssymbolene  msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolene steve maviglio  a spokesman for california gov gray davis who recently sold calpine stock after conflictofinterest concerns were raised  said earlier this month that barrettos investment met state ethics rules because enron wasnt making sales in the spot market  where the dwr employee was involved in making power purchases dwr employees investments are thoroughly reviewed to make sure there are no conflicts  dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests  hidalgo said an ose spokesman  yier shi  said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of california consumers its pretty obvious that it isnt in the interest of california consumers  the dwr or the iso to have that conflict of interest in the powerpurchasing process  shi said why is dwr getting preferential access thats the core issue  shi added allowing dwr power traders into the iso control room is a real conflict because dwr is the major buyer in the state  said lynne church  president of the electric power supply association  whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in california having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorterterm markets are charging  including whats being sold and to whom  church said any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access  she said  noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access its just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence during the aug 2 hearing that ose chaired  winter agreed that having dwr employees in the control room was a problem the iso is working very hard to get them out  he said the access was provided back in january  after the dwr was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to about 10 billion in power on behalf of the states bankrupt and nearbankrupt investorowned utilities  pacific

take on the responsibility unless the iso granted the agency access to the control room  winter told oses subcommittee the arrangement was necessary to avert imminent blackouts  he said the dwr will withdraw its employees from the iso control room effective sept 1  pete garris  who oversees power purchases for the dwr  announced over the weekend it wasnt our intent to be there on a permanent basis  said hidalgo  the dwr spokesman  who described the privilege as a temporary move to keep the lights on now that the states electricity crisis has lessened  the dwrs goal is to have the traders out of the iso control room by sept 1  hidalgo said were pleased to see that the dwr is working toward resolving its conflict of interest problems with the iso  said shi  the ose aide we hope this

2075,0, good afternoon i have created psw documents for all 4 of my regions for june 21  here are my findings today in preschedule workspace what worked i was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the psw i was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point i needed i was able to change the color of text and fonts at will when running the confirm function i was able to print the error log  which was helpful when i had to fix a few counterparty errors the routing speed was still very good what needs improvement the run time for the confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production the rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload  the mid c sheet took over two hours i have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue i will continue uploading today  and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm i could not import the palo verde sheet in to confirm i got this error message erroraccess violation at address 004ed7e3 in module preschedwsexe read of address 00000000 we need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet  i used another half hour fixing the errors and rerunning the sheet a spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs nonphysical everything shows nonphysical routing still did not happen on the northwest delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points question will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the e is now  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1  2  etc  is it does not give the porpod or the firmness of the transmission  the way a path should look is like this srppveapstpvww o23305 fwalctwwmead o464521 mnfepminevp   the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be   srppveaps23305walc464521nevp  this is incomplete information or  would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the trans and oasis number cells instead of aps   put apstpvww and in the oasis cell put 23305 f in path confirmation what worked i was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better the speed to pull up an individual path is much better i was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them the save takes too long  but it worked what still needs work i still cannot sort by global id or tag number would a different tag logic work  instead of pwx tag 123  show 123 pwx tag some marketers use letters for tags the cell with the path in the expanded view must autosize to contain all of the path the program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passedupstreamsupplyetranstranstransmarketdownstreamright now some run together the path cut needs work  it is cumbersome  unclear on some entry requirements  and does not seem to recognize any number i put in it this app seems like guesswork new path needs work as well the por and pod needs to be a type and complete field like in build route selection not a first letter drop down list the counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical it should mimic the deal entry list the new record should be three tiered  supply first  then market both mandatory entry  then transmission as an optional third to allow a supply without a market record is going to create many problems how are these new records going to be routed also  our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry  not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into path cut i will continue testing tomorrow  the hotspots i see now are the upload speed to path confirmation  and a close look at how we need the path cut and new path to work we are getting there  i am very encouraged cara

2081,0, according to this article  morgan stanley now controls about onethird of the southern interties total northbound capacity  or about 1 145 megawatts  until february 2002  then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until march 2003sch wall street joins the energy players by les blumenthal bee washington bureau published june 9  2001 washington  wall streets interest in the west coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for muchneeded generating plants morgan stanley  which earned more than 55 billion last year  has quietly purchased a major share of one of the bonneville power administrations huge transmission lines that link california with the pacific northwest the 18 million deal caught bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on capitol hill morgan stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the socalled intertie to ship power purchased in the southwest for sale to utilities in washington state and oregon although most of the attention in the western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from texas and other southern states  morgan stanley ranks among the 15 largest power marketers in the nation  according to reports filed with the federal energy regulatory commission morgan stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in 1995  the first wall street firm to take such a step merrill lynch also is registered with the commission wall street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities  including energy  said judy hitchen  a morgan stanley spokeswoman in new york but many in the utility industry said they hadnt realized morgan stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading i wasnt aware of it  mark crisson  superintendent of tacoma power  said of morgan stanleys purchase of capacity on the intertie it shows how things are changing and in congress  rep peter defazio  dore  said morgan stanleys direct involvement in west coast electricity markets wasnt all that surprising its wonderfully lucrative for a few folks  defazio said this is the big new game its the new world of deregulated energy bonneville has four major transmission lines linking california and the northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of seattle the lines were built by the federal government  are operated by the transmission arm of bpa and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that bonneville could hog the regions power grid morgan stanley now controls about onethird of the lines total northbound capacity  or about 1 145 megawatts  until february 2002 then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until march 2003 bpa and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity they sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date  said shepard buchanan  a spokesman for bpas transmission side no one had ever made a longterm purchase of that transmission path before it had never come up before under federal regulation  bpa had no choice but to accept the morgan stanley bid the transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit  theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market buchanan said bonneville would be keeping a close watch on morgan stanley we are concerned  he said we dont want anyone gaming the market by controlling the transmission system we will keep a close eye on morgan stanley and others although not a secret  the deal was finalized in early january and since then has been accompanied by little public notice we purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations  hitchen said in response to written questions morgan stanleys internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing commodity trading revenues rose 34 percent to a record level in fiscal 2000  primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energyrelated products  including electricity  natural gas and crude oil  the companys annual report said increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products  relatively low inventory and reduced production values morgan stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market  saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the intertie it doesnt use to other power marketers  federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales we have also offered capacity for resale to third parties  hitchen said others remain skeptical bonnevilles powermarketing arm also has expressed unease with the morgan stanley contract bonneville sells about 45 percent of the wholesale electricity in the northwest  most of it lowcost hydropower generated at the 29 federal dams on the columbia and snake rivers it also controls about 75 percent of the regions electric transmission grid crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because morgan stanley and other wall street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants it doesnt surprise me a lot that they are marketing power  he said they are capitalists but they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities

2083,0, two things  1 weather tracking  did we decide to ask fundamentals about tracking forecastedtoactual temperatures or would you me to organize this specifically for real time 2 bpa transmission losses  would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily  weekly  or monthly basis for billing purposes and general clarity  i think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs ie pay them back in an annuity each day  week  or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge  too much room for error also  darin presto and casey anderson should both have 100 access to the systems they need but it seems to be an ongoing process  so well keep our fingers crossed let me know what your thoughts are on these two things thanks  kate

someone actually going on vacation to see it pour rain  sick sick individual lets see the first day all we did was tour the city and allow lil miss nikki to be a spy  portland was great no wonder you live in the middle of down town  there were so many things to do and see  unfortunately because we didnt exactly have a good idea of where to go and so on and so forth we just wondered around aimlessly then on saturday we all drove to astoriayou knew i just had to go  it was great  absolutely beautiful  on the way we stopped at the fresh berry market and had the most amazing berries oh they were good  next we ate at a little fish place mmmmclam chowder and fried seafood  then went to cannon beach  what a great little town  i bought some pulled taffy and some hot chocolate and was in heaven  alot of the beach sites   for example haystack rock were in the goonies film  then of course i found the little hotel that kindergarten cop was filmed in  what a loser i was taking pictures like a fool bill you dont understand  for years and years every saturday after cartoons i would pop kc into the vcr  i loved it ok ok dorky but hey you have to have some abnormalities in your life then if you havent been here i am going to be the one to take you for your first timeif youll let me  and hey dont get any wild hairs about exploring this before hand misterim the tour guide on this baby  its outside of cannon beach just past hug point  its a little trek called falcon cove  you can reach the beach and it is the most beautiful hike we went on finally we drove back into town and ate at the most discusting little dive downtown  bush gardens  blech  horrible i felt like i had licked the hair on my dogs butt  oooo it was just gross then of course i got to meet you  that was a nice highlight to my trip you rate right up there along side the kc hotel rooms  yeah i kinda like ya   next morning i ate the best breakfast of my entire life  not kidding  its something like the otwalia  its in the westin hotel  ok we all shared our plates so this was our breakfastssarah got a fruit plate  i got eggs benedict and todd got pecan encrusted french toast with orange zing butter and syrup  swear to god that is the first place i want to go to eat when i get to go back  ok it was a little pricey though  not tooo bad  it was 3125 for 3 of us  not alot but breakfast is usually like 5 bucks the next two days were spent in hood river cascade lockes  we hiked the mananomah whatever falls the next day we rented bikes and rode them around the town of stevens wa  15 miles  i was really hurting by that night 34 of the trail was up hill  oh my tail end hurt like crazy  in stevens we ate at a little snack shop  it was probably one of the better places  oh what was its name  oh little vikings  really cute place  youve gotta go  oh one more that i wont recommendtugboat annies in hood river again i felt like i had given an atb to someone  too fancy  im a meat and potatoe girl  that fancy stuff is nice sometimes but usually they just over do it we ate at stanfords the last day and it was another fancy place  i ordered onion rings and they were good  the salad was horrible  so on a food rating scale portlandoregon recieves a 70  i guess im just not going to the right places as you can tell by the length of this i am at work and needing to use some of my time up  you are the poor sap ive chosen since you dont know me yet well the move out date is set for me  i move out on july 31  im not too sure when the townhouse will be available though so im playing it by ear do you have any idea when your trip out there might fall  if you have a ball park idea that might be nice until you get concrete dates  i just want to be sure that im off of work as much as possible the day or days that you have elected to spend with me  that is if you still want to spend them with me  i mean i did sort of stalk your house and found out where you livedthat cant be good  ok i honestly and sincerely feel bad about that whole situation  im just sort of a small town girl who knows that those things really arent appropriate but do them regardless  youll understand once we become better friends  i warned you a little though  i did say that i was spontaneous and might just show up on your doorstep  well there you go i did please dont tell brendan  you probably already did  i actually need to email him and tell him what a sweetheart he is for introducing me to you the small amount of time i got to spend with you was very nice  i look forward to doing that again sometime  well just up hte time slot a hair ok i will let your weary eyes seetle back to work  oh i did receive your voicemail on my phone but it was in nm  i wouldnt have had time anyhow but thank you for your

2104,0, iso market participants since trade month november 2000 which settled beginning in january 2001  payment defaults in the iso markets have caused the iso to pay less than the full amount due scheduling coordinators scs in the monthly cash clearing process  the purpose of this message is to describe the isos policies and procedures in settling the market when defaults occur as set forth in section sabp 674 of the iso tariff  when payment defaults occur from scs that have obligations to the isos markets debtor scs  the shortfall is to be prorated to scs with net amounts due them creditor scs based on their outstanding balances the principles that drive how amounts are settled and defaults are allocated to creditor scs are summarized below proportionate allocation of defaults  the total amount of market defaults is allocated to the creditor scs on a proportionate basis such that each creditor sc receives the same percentage of their total net amount receivable for the month  scs are allowed to net the credits and debits on a monthly basis as described below  the intent of the tariff is to equitably distribute market shortfalls only to those scs that have net market receivables for the period each month is treated as a whole period  final and preliminary invoices are combined when possible see exception conditions below in allocating market defaults  cash payments from the market are received in two stages preliminary and final  at preliminary  market payments are distributed based on the preliminary amounts due to the creditor scs as set forth in the preliminary invoices final invoices serve essentially as trueups to the preliminary invoices  and accordingly  payments received at final are redistributed to the extent possible to achieve trueup allocations for the whole month considering the combined amounts due the creditor scs from both the preliminary and final invoices each month is treated as a discrete period  market defaults are generally allocated to the creditor scs that have amounts due for the month being settled  the exceptions to this rule involve 1 scs that are creditor scs in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods or 2 debtor scs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for prior months  in the first instance  the creditor sc would not be paid to the extent of default obligations from prior months  amounts due to the creditor sc would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period in the second instance the current months payment is carried back and applied first to the oldest outstanding balance the proceeds would be distributed to the creditor scs for that earlier period based on the creditor scs unpaid balances in that month  with respect to the carry back of payments to the earliest period  pre and post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from different scs gmc defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments   gmc is billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final invoices each month  in the event of payment default on any gmc invoices at either preliminary or final  market funds are transferred to satisfy gmc obligations before any market distributions are made  this first priority position for gmc revenues is set forth in section sabp 6313 of the iso tariff  therefore  when both gmc and market defaults occur as has occurred in each of the past few months  the creditor scs have two reductions to the market clearing amounts ultimately paid  an allocated portion of the gmc default  and an allocated portion of the market default rmr invoices and payments are not affected by market or gmc defaults  the rmr invoicing process involves amounts due from the ptos to the rmr owners as set forth in monthly invoices processed through the isos systems however  such amounts are invoiced independent of the isos market and gmc billing processes  and accordingly  market andor gmc defaults do not impact rmr related payments there are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of allocating cash to creditor scs when defaults occur  some of these factors include amounts received after payment date deadlines  such amounts are typically included in the next distribution market payments due to creditor scs that default on gmc in the current month  such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount of the gmc default by the creditor sc allocations to prior months  not made unless the amount exceeds 05 of that months billed amounts small invoices under 5 000 are paid in full rather than the allocated percentage for more information about these allocation issues or any other related matters  please contact melodie iverson 916 3512174 email mkiversoncaisocom mailtomiversoncaisocom  or mike epstein 916 3512314 email mepsteincaisocom mailtomepsteincaisocom  at the iso byron b woertz

2153,0,   published thursday  aug 9  2001  in the san jose mercury news western power grid has close call delivery problem could have led to blackouts throughout region stern warning issued to power generators who didnt deliver last week federal investigation urged by john woolfolk mailtojwoolfolksjmercurycom and steve johnson mailtosjohnsonsjmercurycom mercury news the western power grid serving 65 million people nearly collapsed a week ago when generators failed to deliver promised electricity  a problem california officials warned wednesday is occurring with alarming frequency last thursdays close call could have knocked out power in 14 states and parts of canada and mexico  causing the regions worst outages in five years youre standing on the edge of a cliff when a generator fails to do what you order them to do  said jim detmers  vice president of grid operations at the california independent system operator its not just california thats at risk its the whole western united states the dire warning comes as californias energy crisis seems to be easing  with not one of the predicted blackouts rolling across the state so far this summer the intricately balanced system came so close to failure last thursday that an unexpected outage at just one generator anywhere in the region could have triggered blackouts  detmers said airtraffic analogy detmers likened the problem to airliners ignoring orders from the airtraffic control tower the iso controls the california grid  scheduling delivery of electricity much as control towers schedule airplanes for landings its really no different than if a plane comes into san francisco international airport and doesnt follow the rules of the air traffic controller  detmers said we had a near miss on our system you had two planes getting very close although the iso has seen similar problems as far back as december  last weeks event prompted grid managers to fire a stern warning late wednesday to californias power generators and to call for federal regulators to investigate the warning cited a growing pattern among market participants of untenable acts that include failure to comply with dispatch instructions such system performance threatens the reliability of the western interconnection and cannot be tolerated  the iso report said steve maviglio  spokesman for gov gray davis  said he hadnt been notified of the grid managers concerns  but after being read language in the report  said it was pretty strong stuff coming from the iso jan smutnyjones  a former iso official who heads the independent energy producers association  which represents generators  said he was unaware of the reported problems but agreed the matter is a serious one the issue that the iso is identifying here  i cant recall ever seeing that before  smutnyjones said  adding that it is crucial to get to the bottom of what the problem is and fix it quick system reliability is important to everybody  he said companies not named grid officials would not name the companies involved or say whether they believe the problems resulted from confusion or attempts to manipulate the system to boost market prices the offenders were reported to federal regulators who will make that call  detmers said smutnyjones said the problem may stem from lingering confusion among energy sellers over the federal energy regulatory commissions june 19 order extending price controls throughout the west i dont think anybody is deliberately trying to put the system in jeopardy  smutnyjones said there is some confusion and some controversy around grid managers cited two recent examples of problems that are threatening the stability of the system in one case  a generator scheduled far more power than it was capable of delivering and fell more than 1 600 megawatts short a megawatt is enough to power some 750 homes or more in another case  a generator balked at an iso order to deliver power needed to stabilize the system because electricity must be used as it is produced  the grid manager must precisely match power supply with demand throughout the day a mismatch can trigger circuit breakers throughout the system  causing widespread blackouts the last major failure on the western grid was on july 2  1996  when a tree growing too close to a highvoltage line in idaho sparked outages across the region affecting 2 million customers managers goal grid managers aim to keep the system running at a frequency of 60 hertz it normally fluctuates between 6001 and 5999 hertz  detmers said last thursday  it fell to 5993 hertz blackouts can begin when it gets down to 5965 hertz  he said every loss of 1 000 megawatts costs the system 10 hertz  he said a substantial drop in frequency can cause widespread outages that can take days to fix  he said to maintain balance  the iso must keep supply and demand within 117 megawatts  detmers said last thursday  the system slipped more than 1 100 megawatts out of balance for more than 10 minutes and was as much as 1 500 megawatts off contact john woolfolk at jwoolfolksjmercurycom mailtojwoolfolksjmercurycom or 408 2783410 embedded picture metafile embedded picture metafile

2155,0, dave  kim i think we should reference this article as an example of how price controls degrade reliability bill  if you have any further insights on what happened that day  let dave perrino or sue mara know thanks  alan officials study grids close call published friday  aug 10  2001  in the san jose mercury news by steve johnson  john woolfolk and glennda chui mercury news two energy agencies announced thursday that they are investigating charges some california generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity  and atlantabased mirant admitted it had a role in last weeks incident that briefly imperiled the western power grid california officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on aug 2 and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse  threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to 65 million people but it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again some generators and a federal official questioned the california independent system operators handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified but stephanie mccorkle with the california agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didnt follow orders and she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity we asked them over and over why theyre not following our dispatch instructions  she said  adding that some have provided explanations that dont add up it makes us suspicious mccorkle said the aug 2 incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power that left the western grid  a vast network of highvoltage lines  transformers and other electrical gear that spans 14 states and parts of canada and mexico  with a sudden and severe electrical shortage if uncorrected  she and others said  it could have led to widespread power outages although officials need to keep the grids electrical frequency at 60 hertz  the aug 2 shortage lowered it to 5993 hertz state officials said blackouts could occur at 5965 hertz mccorkle declined to name the companies involved but patrick dorinson  a spokesman for mirant  which has three plants in the bay area  said it was partly responsible while offering few details about what happened  he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee not making a timely call and some software problems with our computers it happens  dorinson said people make mistakes an official with the federal energy regulatory commission  one of the agencies investigating the matter  said it views the aug 2 incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesnt happen again the agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order but at this point  the official said  its unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion  incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices the official said the agency also wants to know why the california independent system operator didnt declare a statewide emergency on aug 2 when the promised electricity wasnt delivered had it done so  he said  the agency would have had more leverage over the generators some power company representatives complained that the iso doesnt always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs for many plants  it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to ramp up  said richard wheatley  a spokesman with reliant energy of houston you physically cant do it but iso officials defended their procedures  and spokesman gregg fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on aug 2 wouldnt have been feasible this was so quick  he said it was less than half an hour total from start to finish  and we were able to deal with it appropriately without suffering blackouts the incident also is being looked into by the western systems coordinating council  a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials  which sets rules for managing grids in the regions nearly 18 million square miles robert dintelman  the agencys assistant executive director  said brief electricity fluctuations  such as the one that hit california or worse  occur once or twice a month across the west on aug 1  for example  the frequency dipped to 5975 in montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there  dintelman said but he said californias claim that generators arent following orders is unusual that is alarming  he added the council can issue fines for some rule violations but dintelman said hes not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power nationally  such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak  said ellen vancko of the north american electric reliability council her group has been pushing congress to make the system tougher  but the legislation has stalled meanwhile  she said  grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide although the motivation for these incidents varies  she said  sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves  even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk  contact steve johnson at sjohnsonsjmercurycom

2169,0, i have obtained a copy of a letter from representative tauzin and others to ferc chairman hebert which appears below  it could provide some indication of the direction ferc will take with the order it plans to issue next monday  summarizing  the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire wscc  which plan should prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response please see details below june 12  2001 the honorable curt h bert  jr chairman federal energy regulatory commission 888 first street  ne washington dc  20426 dear chairman hbert since last summer  the committee on energy and commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in california  today  the west continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century  and california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer  after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west  including several hearings in washington and california  we recommend that the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into california we recognize the commissions efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets  including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices  while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west  we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come  to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead  we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets  we strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire western systems coordinating council wscc specifically  such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the wscc  the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power  if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan  it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law aware of the danger of discouraging supply  the commission has relied upon marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts  we share the commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supply accordingly  to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution  the commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission to mitigate prices and increase available supply  we also urge the commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market  in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs  consumers have less incentive to conserve  while demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals  a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell  at market or other incentive prices  foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume specifically  the commission should 1 establish or certify a wholesale clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and 2 enable consumers  whether individually or through aggregation arrangements  to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs  but a broader  regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer  we understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state laws  abrogating existing contracts  or shifting costs to nonparticipant consumers we look forward to working with you to build upon the commissions previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter  to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead  we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible  we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on friday  june 22  if you have questions please contact our staff  thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request

2175,0, group  this is an email i sent to our generators regarding decing and buyback strategies  please read so you know whats going  and can take the lead on implementing these strategies  well let you know when all the generators on board thanks  stan  due to the relatively weak realtime market during morning hours  we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buyingback generation that youve sold forward  we want to stress that this is a relatively shortterm strategy  as the weather turns cold during the lateautumn and winter months  the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the realtime market lately  he110 have been very weak realtime  ranging between 25 and 40  we have two strategies that we would like to suggest 1  decremental supplemental bids we can submit dec bids to the iso at a price below your cost to generate  basically  we would be letting the iso know that were willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mws from the iso to cover the prescheduled quantity  you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity  but instead of generating it  you would be buying it from the iso  for example  if your cost to generate is 40  and you sell dayahead for 50  you make 10mwh  if the iso takes the decremental bid  and the price is 30  then you make 20mwh advantages  a relatively large upside  the price the iso charges could actually go negative  as large as negative 9187  also  you would actually be buying from the iso  as opposed to selling to the iso and being subject to credit risk disadvantages  ten minute dispatch  when we submit decremental bids  the iso has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes  in addition to the physical problems this might create  the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow 2  buyingback blocks in the bilateral market this strategy calls for our realtime traders to buy blocks of energy in the bilateral market for below your cost to generate  this would call for you to reduce your generation  and the energy we buyback in the realtime market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity  once again  you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity  but instead of generating it  you would be buying it at the price paid to buyback the energy   as in the previous example  if your cost to generate is 40  and you sell dayahead for 50  you make 10mwh  if we can buyback the energy for a price of 30  then you make 20mwh   additionally  if we do buyback the energy  we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the iso to remain compliant with the ferc order  then  if the iso takes the incremental bid  you can generate the power and sell for additional profit advantages  no 10 minute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted  you would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced  also  the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage disadvantage  not as large of an upside as decremental bidding at this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy 2  buyingback blocks of energy in the bilateral market  once you and our realtime traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy  then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the iso  we propose a 5050 profit split  above your dayahead profit  earned from either of these two strategies if you have any questions or comments please call myself or chris foster stan cocke the services desk 5034643829

2186,0, these guys filed a bunch of complaints against sempra too  back when sempra owned the plantsch dukes calif whistleblowers have history of grievances  updated wednesday  june 27  2001 0736 pm et by jason leopold of dow jones newswires los angeles dow jonesthree former employees who last week told california lawmakers duke energy duk investmentsquotessymbolduk  news investmentsnewssymbolduk  msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolduk ramped down its south bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant  including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination  the men told dow jones newswires most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plants previous owner  sempra energy sre investmentsquotessymbolsre  news investmentsnewssymbolsre  msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolsre unit san diego gas  electric  for which the men continued to work while duke controlled the plant but interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with dukes profitcentered management style in the deregulated market duke has called the employees allegations about its operating procedures baseless duke has said the employees have an ax to grind  because they werent hired by the company in april when escrow on the power plant closed and duke acquired some of sdges workforce the men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers  who are locked in a highstakes struggle with the state of california over allegations of price gouging the state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives glenn johnson  52  a mechanic at the south bay power plant  alone filed 30 complaints on one occasion  johnson said he called the california division of occupational safety and health  because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos he also has a harassment complaint against sdge regarding an employee who now works for duke  but johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it aside from the formal complaints  johnson said under the duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment this is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business  he said one of the other employees  jim olkjer  56  a former assistant control room operator at the power plant  filed three complaints against sdge while duke operated the plant  because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision the grievances were either turned down or settled  he said olkjer said he decided to testify against duke after he learned he wouldnt be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in april im on a fixed income now  olkjer said in an interview i cant afford my utility bills on a fixed income the third employee  ed edwards  42  a certified power plant mechanic  said he filed one complaint against three sdge employees in 1999 for racial discrimination one of the employees was hired by duke that case is still pending edwards  an africanamerican  said duke didnt hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired lessqualified white employees edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under sdge were replaced with white employees when duke took over edwards  who stopped working at the plant in february  said he decided to testify against duke after receiving a phone call from johnson i knew i wouldnt be hired  he said edwards and johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against sdge with the us equal employment opportunity commission sdge spokesman art larson wouldnt comment on the allegations duke spokesman tom williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and always hires the most qualified employees in 1999  duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the us department of labor for 769 700  in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions dissatisfaction with new priorities the former employees said they werent motivated to blow the whistle on duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state johnson first alerted the media about dukes behavior before state attorney general bill lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers the employees each earned about 1 000 a week all three employees said they believe duke mismanaged the south bay power plant by ramping the units up and down  tossing out spare parts  and operating machinery when it was broken olkjer said he saw the plants output reduced during the worst power emergencies at least 50 times when edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him  its none of your business the employees said that duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff  and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant i was paid to twist wrenches  johnson said the last raise i got two years ago was 225 thats an insult to my skill duke said it is bringing the former sdge employees under its contract with international brotherhood of electrical workers local 1245 the workers were previously represented by another local  and duke wanted a single contract johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on duke because he was disgusted by the companys gluttony and greed he said he stole the control room logs in february after a colleague pointed out to him that duke was reducing output at the plant johnson  edwards and olkjer said in the old days the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down but as soon as deregulation became law in the state  things started to change sdge would also vary the plants output  but not as dramatically as duke did  they said to the best of my recollection  we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time  edwards said once duke took the reins  that changed we were no longer a family duke has said that it adjusted the plants output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the california independent system operator  manager of the states power grid the iso frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid  and the employees who testified werent in a position to know the whole picture  said bill hall  vice president of dukes western operations duke spokesman tom williams said the company plans to release data showing the iso ordered the plant to ramp up and down jan 1618  the period cited from the controlroom logs  to keep supply in balance a copy of the iso controlroom logs obtained by dow jones newswires shows that the iso did make such orders during a stage 3 emergency  because it didnt need dukes capacity  which it thought too expensive by jason leopold  dow jones newswires 3236583874 jasonleopolddowjonescom mailtojasonleopolddowjonescom embedded picture metafile

2201,0, important notice underscheduling penalty and pge bankruptcy proof of claims as you are aware  the claims bar date in the pge bankruptcy is september 5th  consistent with our practice of providing information held by the iso to market participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in part by pge  the iso is today sending to each scheduling coordinator an accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the underscheduling penalty is not modified by ferc  ferc adopted the underscheduling penalty in a december 15  2000 order  because there are several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty  to date the iso has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing pursuant to the underscheduling penalty  it is our expectation that scheduling coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they schedule  information that is relevant to them as we have advised in prior market notices  although the iso settles transactions on behalf of market participants  the iso is neither authorized nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of market participants in any bankruptcy proceeding  ie assert claims of iso debtors against iso creditors iso tariff section 11201  further  while the iso may be asked by an iso debtor to assert such claims in the px or pge bankruptcy cases  the iso is not obliged to do so and will decline any such request  the iso expressly disavows any liability for any market participants claims  whether or not the market participant files any such proofs of claim in the px or pge bankruptcy proceedings further  as we have advised in prior market notices  all statements  including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty  are subject to change  a number of transactions are currently known to be the subject of disputes and market reruns  there are also proceedings pending at ferc  federal courts  and state courts  the outcomes of which may affect amounts owed by pge to each market participant or by the market participant to pge in addition  we anticipate that further disputes and proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect the calculation of such amounts  the iso will continue to work diligently to resolve these matters as quickly as possible  nonetheless  it is clear that significant issues may remain unresolved andor unidentified by the claims bar date market participants should consult their own legal counsel as to their respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the px and pge client relations communications crcommunicationscaisocom mailtocrcommunicationscaisocom

2231,0, i am working in the target date of june 20th  today i added schedules from palo verde and the entire midc sheet to the testing group once cob is added  we will have pretty much an average daily volume here is my attached worksheet for mid c in preschedule workspace i added palo verde to the group of deals imported  and ran a total of 37 lines into the path confirmation the rest of the sheet was all bookouts  and so i marked them for routing only  i do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation this will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for real time and settlements i would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up  as the lists can be long  and i have to make notes on what is wrong also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time  we currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths this would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet  instead of cleaning up afterwards routing functionality question  if we change a delivery point in scheduling bpa nw delivered gets moved and changed every day  do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point  these types of deals route now  i would like to duplicate that existing functionality i did get an error message on those lines  capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points please see the attached sheet  there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86  but it is all deals that are our bpa northwest delivered the routing speed is excellent one second per line or less all the way in portland on local enpower the megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging my palo data was corrupted  so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points my plan is to attack the alias stuff from a different angle we are going to work with the team that sets the enpower short name to something that is workable  i would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that enpower short name in path confirmation the early sorting looks good  things look very versatile and useable yesterday i identified several problems 1 the entire path needs to be shown in both counterparty paths currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp 2 the alias list is not functioning properly  the enpower long name needs to be shown in the collapsed counterparty view  along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp 3 confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch  not pulling up each deal line by line today  i am finding the following 1  when a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view   the system blows away the schedule term and the delivery point  these fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur 2i am not allowed to sort by global id   even though global ids are populated there my idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section  no globals go in another section  and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys 3 pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes  this is to long to be practical in production for real time i would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less 4  all paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked  even though none have been cut yet 5 the grey on grey color scheme is not going to work  but that is a little thing lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable variations of the beige color are easier to read 6 the path cut button and dialog boxes i think are going to need alot of work  it looks like i will have to do all the enpower work first  and then populate the cut this is a bit different than we discussed  my plan is to take this as far as i can  and then hand it over to bill williams iii and his group for final tweaking 7 i also cannot sort by tag number  we need that thank you all for your work on this  it is really looking good i have to schedule on monday  but will jump right back in when i am finished with daily tasks cara

2240,0, bill  this is an awesome story  i was too awestruck to fully understand when you explained yesterday  companies can make and lose money  people get promoted  emails are exchanged but you never forget the moments like an omelet lady catching on fire  i hope she is ok  it sounds serious  hey  great show last night  i took off at the end of the 1st encore  talk to you later  scott   original message  from williams iii  bill mailtobillwilliamsiiienroncom  sentwednesday  july 11  2001 1110 am  tokuehn  m scott  subjectre goodday captain   scott   this is from a guy on our floor  hes a summer internand this is  his tuesday morning story  incidentally i was standing directly in front  of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell  broke loose  i took about three steps back and wandered towards the  kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher  didnt find one  and like scott  the intern was a bit disappointed in my reactionsah well     i dont usually send out a group email  but listen to this shit  so i am  sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks  loose  it is about 630am  and most of the trading has subsided for the  morning  i decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women  that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the  food will lasttoday is a special day because we get a fresh cooked  breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that  we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh  breakfast for enron employees  they usually cook it the night before so   everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility  of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the  afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green  eggs  so  i grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70  yearold women at the grill  everyone is smiling  deciding whether or not  they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something  the next thing you know  straight out of a fox tv show or youve gotta  see this episodethis old woman is engulfed in flames like the great  fire of chicago  the propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the  flames are high and wide  raising up to ten feet in height  the place  turns into a frenzy nobody can move  react  or anything  everyone is  frozen watching this old womanpicture happy gilmores grandma go up like  an old christmas tree  a few seconds before this high school chemistry  experiment  i was sitting on the first row right in the middle and i was  staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the  sports ticker on espn2 on the 50inch liquid flatscreen tv that is directly  above my desk the old woman that went into flames is directly in front of  me  about a literal three feet away and i am directly facing the inferno  along with a coworker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the  flames i dont save the old woman like most of you might have thought  i  cant do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going  to jump in there and save this poor lady  the old woman is yelling   somebody get me outta hereyet we all continue to starefinally   someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze  who is this masked  man  i have no clue  however  i do witness les from middle marketing  doing his best maurice greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which  he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is i see  someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier  which is  funny  if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair  and her arms are about to blister up  the blaze is extinguished after  taking a hell of a toll on the old woman  ruining the flat screen tv that  used to sit above me  and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of  computer screens  the alarm in our building 3 world trade center is  screaming  and the smoke is enough to make even polarek leave the area  so  the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building  and on her way to the hospital  who knows what condition she is in  but  all i know is i hope i am never around a bunch of vaginasmyself and the  rest of us that did nothing when i go up in flames someday  well  i have  to get back to work because i have wasted about 20 minutes writing this  drama  take care  scotty    hope you liked the show last night  take it easy b  cdtf

2244,0, good afternoon ron  we just had a meeting with bill williams  head of realtime trading in portland  to discuss some problems we are having with the realtime deals flowing to the deal confirmation system  currently  the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by realtime to reflect actual volumetric flow  price are not seen by the confirmation groups  one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the realtime traders use deal entry to make all the changes  this solution will not work  if the realtime guys start changing the deals in deal entry  the original negotiated deal will be lost  also  and more importantly  the time to make all the changes for the realtime adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing thanks   david poston it manager  portland

2263,0, please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on bloomberg 1 bloomberg charges a 15 flat broker fee 2 this fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade 3 this fee applies each time you make a trade on bloomberg ie 15 per hit or lift  regardless of volume 4 when you extend a bloomberg deal in deal entry  account for each separate trade accordingly by adding 15 to any existing broker fee 5 because this fee is flat  select the flat button to the right of the broker fee  6 and most importantly  make a note in the broker box that the broker is in fact bloomberg i know that many of you were never notified of the bloomberg fee structure  but going forward we should see every trade done on bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with bloomberg the confirms group in houston has compiled a weighty list of missing hourly trades since the advent of real time bloomberg trading i believe these are all in the system  but possibly short a broker name and fee this  going forward  should no longer be a problem please let me know if you have any questions regarding bloomberg trading andor fees thanks  kate

2283,0, ose puts the blame where it belongs by pointing out that the isos favoritism towards dwr cost california billions in potential refunds isos role in sales is rapped critics challenge the independence of the power grid operator by david whitney bee washington bureau published aug 3  2001 washington  the independence of californias power transmission grid operator and its electricity sales to the state department of water resources came under fire at a house of representatives hearing thursday but grid operators said there was no way that armslength transactions with the department of water resources could have been negotiated beginning in january when power blackouts were imminent and the state was the only buyer with money rep doug ose  rsacramento  chairman of the house governmental affairs energy policy panel  charged in a prepared statement to open the hearing that the cozy relationship between the dwr and the california independent system operator could result in the state forfeiting any claim to refunds for overcharges by power generators the states interference into caliso has possibly cost californians billions of dollars in potential refunds  ose said moreover  it represents a serious violation of the federal energy regulatory commissions regulations at issue is the fact that the iso is run by a fiveperson board appointed by the governor when  under federal law  it is supposed to be independent additionally  the isos biggest customer is the dwr  which buys power using state money to firm up power deliveries by utilities too cashstarved to buy it themselves last week  the ferc determined that the dwr would not be entitled to any rate refunds on its power contracts in reaching that decision  the commission cited the agencys special access to information that gave it a competitive advantage over other purchasers terry m winter  iso president and chief executive officer  said that at the time the department of water resources began buying power in january under these unusual circumstances  there were no other buyers willing to step in to keep power flowing to homes and businesses that occurred because the market was not functioning  winter said they were the only creditworthy purchaser purchasing power but kevin madden  the regulatory commissions top lawyer  said the relationship between the iso and the department of water resources raises troubling questions dwr buying on behalf of the state is a market participant  he said it shouldnt be in the iso control room it shouldnt be allowed to cherry pick among power sellers madden said he expects the commission to rule soon on whether the iso should be reconstituted to ensure its independence the bees david whitney can be reached at 202 3830004 or dwhitneymcclatchydccom mailtodwhitneymcclatchydccom you can see this story at httpwwwcapitolalertcomnewscapalert0520010803html copyright  the sacramento bee httpwwwsacbeecomaboutuslegal

2290,0, here is the transcript of the isos realtime desk asking enron realtime trader ryan slinger to help the iso set the marketclearing price mcp for replacement energy  the iso wanted enron to help set the mcp for replacement energy at 9186  because the iso was upset that the mcp had dropped to a penny  and now market participants were buying the isos excess energy a penny after having sold it to the iso for 91 the day before there are two phone calls  the first call is the iso calling to ask us to help it to set the price  the next call occurs three minutes later and is the iso calling because we didnt put in the bid  our trader told the iso that he had to talk to his boss because he didnt want to do anything wrong note  i have just learned a complicating detail  coincidentally  our desk did put in a bid for 9186 for hour 18  which was what the iso had requested  however  the bid had been formulated before the iso called our desk transcription of a telephone conversation between the isos real time desk and enrons real time desk  july 3  2001  144050  144338 enron  enron  this is david porter iso  hi david  this is allen at the iso enron  david hi allen  how ya doing iso

this isnt on a recorded line  but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing  it would be good to keep it the market clearing price for replacement energy at a higher price  it doesnt matter how many megawatts you  put it at  but we want to clear it at a higher price enron  ryan  wait  you said were not on a recorded line  or we are iso  allen  were not  no  were not  okay  we already talked to the dayahead research guy and myself  but we saw you guys clear at 91 and we wanted you  if its possible  to continue to set that  whether its 20 mw or whatever you want to put in there enron  ryan  okay  um iso  allen  we want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market enron  ryan  oh yeah  because it had been clearing like at 100  hadnt it iso  allen  not replacement enron  ryan  oh  not replacement iso  allen  no  what happened is that we bought it backsee  the dayahead was purchased at like 100 and then what happened is that the hourahead   a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the inter ties  they were faking it  so we wanted to keep the price up high allen and ryan  unintelligible enron  ryan  so they were selling it  oh  in the day ahead  and buying it back iso  allen  buying like 60 bucks   trying to make money off of it  then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny enron  ryan  oh  thats ridiculous iso  allen  thats really ticking us off and right now    enron  ryan  that to me signals  thats probably powerex  isnt it iso  allen  theres about four of them right now enron  ryan  shit iso  allen  and for the dayahead for tomorrow  we didnt  we didnt  we took them out  basically  were not allowing  anything over the ties enron  ryan  i didnt submit one for 17 or  iso  allen  thats fine  theyll probably go to a penny and theyll probably get excited and do a bunch  and well hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91 enron  ryan  okay  all right  well  ill see what i can do iso  allen  i appreciate it  its actually in the best interest for the state and the iso with what these guys are doing  so we are trying to put a stop to it enron  ryan okay iso  allen  thanks  bye transcription of a telephone conversation between the isos real time desk and enrons real time desk  july 3  2001  144655  144740 3 minutes later enron  this is ryan iso  hey ryan  its allen enron  ryan  yeah iso  allen  hey  did you put it in for the next hour enron  ryan  for hour 16 iso  allen  yeah  no  they

2303,0, mark  the ad hoc teams product is attached  it is a suggested revision to the nerc a3a1 time table for the wscc  some basic points are elimination of manually setting the wscc preschedule flag  the table provides rules for the etag software to automatically set the flag the majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment  the team agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ie  tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee  tags submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee  approval entities would receive compensation for assessingapproving late tags  etc  but  a financial mechanism would  have to go through a cumbersome reviewapproval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced world of etag and nercs electronic scheduling  so  the suggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer the submittal time is to the start time  to do this  we considered three parameters  the assessment window  deferred denial  and the default composite status the assessment window is a period time that the etag authority service gives the approval services to assess a submitted tag each approval service is to check the tag for various things and respond with a approved or denied vote back to authority service who then set the final composite status deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag  the composite status does not immediately become denied  but instead waits until the end of the assessment window to set the composite status  this allows the denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it  if appropriate the default composite status is a final stated reached at the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to actively approve or deny a tag  currently  tags submitted before a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to approved  tags submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to denied for realtime tagging  we cite the hourahead business where purchasingselling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour tags submitted in the first half of the hourahead  referred to 0 to 30 past  will have a 10 minute assessment window  are subjected to deferred denial  and will default to approvedconditional tags submitted from 30 to 40 past  will have a 10 minute assessment window  are not subjected to deferred denial can be called instant denial  and but will still default to approvedconditional tags submitted in the after 40 past  will have a 5 minute assessment window  are not subjected to deferred denial can be called instant denial  and will default to denied thus assigned a composite status of late the table references specific times in the submittal and assessment process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard  the team was divided on the best approach  some suggested all times on the table be the prevailing time for the lca  this would require each ca to include in the etag registry their time zone  some suggested  all times on the table be in pacific prevailing time  and some suggested that all times on the table be in pacific standard time  the conclusion is that a white paper would be produced prior to the july isas meeting discussing the pros and cons of each suggestion the group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag agents time clock  submittal time should stay with the authority service heres a big one  because the timing table allows for later submittal times  the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of the wscc standard ramp ie  currently starts at 10 minutes before the hour  we are recommending that isas request the oc to study the feasibility of moving the wscc standard ramp from a twenty minute duration straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour ie  starts at 055 and ends at 005  such a change would align the wscc with the eastern interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag submittals there was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice for the tariff deadline for schedule changes most are set to 20 before the start  it was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner the team did not want to address at this time issues concerning multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in policy 3 or the etag specifications finally  the team can not stress enough that a composite status of late should not and does not mean automatic denial  the late designation simple indicates that the default composite status is denied  approval entities should make every effort to assess all tags  late or not hurray for the team members  many  many thanks tag time table

2304,0, ad hocers one last time before we shoot it over to mark and isas  thanks for the comments  good catches tag time table draftrev3doc as far as comment 1 lca vs ppt vs pst  this gets into the white paper idea discussed last wednesday  lisa was going to tackle this shes givenup sleeping to fit it in and id asked her to distinguish between referencing time in a product definition versus time in a process description  but i believe she is on vacation fighting forest fires this table is used in a process submission and assessment of etags and is somewhat independent of the time zones that the product or commodity is referenced by  guess im letting my preference slip in here  since we are dealing with a daily process  the timing table should use a prevailing time reference eg  lca or ppt  etc and not a fixed time zone eg  pst  cst  etc enough of me  lets talk about your comments to the latest table  if there are none  itll go to mark at cob tuesday july 3rd robert harshbarger puget sound energy oasis trading manager 4258824643 desk 2066043251 cell  tag time table draftrev3doc

2365,0, since alan is on vacation i thought i would distribute this message  hopefully it may be something everyone here will find interesting  below there is also excerpt from the introduction related to the ca experience  kind regards   dave original message from thome  jennifer sent tuesday  august 14  2001 858 am to dasovich  jeff guerrero  janel steffes  james d subject caem study gas dereg has saved consumers 600b  fyi  the report is attached ngis daily gas price index published  august 14  2001 caem study gas dereg has saved consumers 600b nearly 20 years of competition in the natural gas market has reduced national energy costs by more than 600 billion  according to a new study issued monday this amounts to perhousehold savings of 5 938 as a result of gas deregulation  which began in the late 1970s with the phased removal of wellhead price ceilings  then graduated to lighterhanded regulation of interstate pipelines and now is focusing on opening up the distribution end  according to the study commissioned by the center for the advancement of energy markets caem  a nonprofit thinktank in washington  dc the nearly 20 years of competition weve experienced in the natural gas industry proves that the right conditions can foster lower costs for consumers and motivate the industry to make investments that benefit the environment  our economy and our national security  said caem ceo ken malloy in addition to the cost savings to the public  the study credits deregulation for the rise in the number of gas suppliers at the wholesale and retail levels a reduction in longterm price fluctuations  although it has triggered more shortterm price volatility greater focus on energyefficient purchases by customers  making gas the fuel of choice for many and industry improvements in how its buys  sells and trades gas supplies in addition  it noted that lighthanded regulation of gas pipelines has been a big factor in passing through lower commodity costs to consumers in short  the study reveals that the gas deregulation skeptics of the 1970s and early 1980s were wrong by a long shot  according to caem what we also need to recognize is that weve witnessed a redistribution of wealth from foreign oil producers to domestic natural gas producers  and that these lower prices have contributed measurably to a more stable inflation rate  lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved our national security due to a reduced reliance on imported oil  said malloy  who formerly was on the staff at ferc and the us energy department the study  entitled california here we come the lessons learned from natural gas deregulation  offers much guidance for the energy markets in the western state 1 put the right regulatory framework in place  half measures are more dangerous than doing nothing 2 dont expect results overnight  stay the course 3 markets do work  and consumers and the environment will be winners under properly executed reform 4 the costs of change are easier to calculate than the benefits all the studies about gas deregulation underestimated the benefits and 5 organized consumer advocates are often very wrong about the impact changes will have on consumers

2398,0, due to the relatively weak realtime market during morning hours  we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buyingback generation that youve sold forward  we want to stress that this is a relatively shortterm strategy  as the weather turns cold during the lateautumn and winter months  the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the realtime market lately  he110 have been very weak realtime  ranging between 25 and 40  we have two strategies that we would like to suggest 1  decremental supplemental bids we can submit dec bids to the iso at a price below your cost to generate  basically  we would be letting the iso know that were willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mws from the iso to cover the prescheduled quantity  you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity  but instead of generating it  you would be buying it from the iso  for example  if your cost to generate is 40  and you sell dayahead for 50  you make 10mwh  if the iso takes the decremental bid  and the price is 30  then you make 20mwh advantages  a relatively large upside  the price the iso charges could actually go negative  as large as negative 9187  also  you would actually be buying from the iso  as opposed to selling to the iso and being subject to credit risk disadvantages  ten minute dispatch  when we submit decremental bids  the iso has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes  in addition to the physical problems this might create  the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow 2  buyingback blocks in the bilateral market this strategy calls for our realtime traders to buy blocks of energy in the bilateral market for below your cost to generate  this would call for you to reduce your generation  and the energy we buyback in the realtime market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity  once again  you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity  but instead of generating it  you would be buying it at the price paid to buyback the energy   as in the previous example  if your cost to generate is 40  and you sell dayahead for 50  you make 10mwh  if we can buyback the energy for a price of 30  then you make 20mwh   additionally  if we do buyback the energy  we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the iso to remain compliant with the ferc order  then  if the iso takes the incremental bid  you can generate the power and sell for additional profit advantages  no 10 minute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted  you would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced  also  the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage disadvantage  not as large of an upside as decremental bidding at this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy 2  buyingback blocks of energy in the bilateral market  once you and our realtime traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy  then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the iso  we propose a 5050 profit split  above your dayahead profit  earned from either of these two strategies if you have any questions or comments please call myself or chris foster stan cocke the services desk 5034643829

2415,0, read this subject america the beautiful in the wake of the election fiasco and the national tragedy of today  this is worth reading we still live in  the greatest country in the world and sometimes we forget what we have worked so hard for   this  from a canadian newspaper  is worth sharing america the good neighbor widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from toronto by gordon sinclair  a canadian television commentator what follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional record this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth germany  japan and  to a lesser extent  britain and italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts none of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the united states when france was in danger of collapsing in 1956  it was the americans who propped it up  and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of paris i was there i saw it when earthquakes hit distant cities  it is the united states that hurries in to help this spring  59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes nobody helped the marshall plan and the truman policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries now newspapers in those countries are writing about  the decadent  warmongering americans id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the united states dollar build its own airplane does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the boeing jumbo jet  the lockheed tristar  or the douglas dc10 if so  why dont they fly them why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon you talk about japanese technocracy  and you get radios you talk about german technocracy  and you get automobiles you talk about american technocracy  and you find men on the moon  not once  but several times  and safely home again you talk about scandals  and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded they are here on our streets  and most of them  unless they are breaking canadian laws  are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here when the railways of france  germany and india were breaking down through age  it was the americans who rebuilt them when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke  nobody loaned them an old caboose both are still broke i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble i dont think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake our neighbors have faced it alone  and im one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around they will come out of this thing with their flag high and when they do  they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles i hope canada is not one of those

2451,0, after slugging it out with the iso last week i think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re unit outages  we need to communicate with 2 different groups  the generation outage desk and the real time desk  first  we fill out an outage report and send it to the generation outage desk  when the outage is over or the period of the outage changes  we are required to telephone the real time outage desk  that phone number is 9163512488  when the calls come in to real time from the iso asking about the outages  they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned the services desk will be responsible for communicating with both the generation outage desk and the real time outage desk  but real time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the iso when they call  services will communicate outages to real time thanks chris

karen belden  tim yoder  christian sanders  richard b subjectas the caiso turns  caiso involved in scam with cdwr to purchase excess power from cdwrs longterm contracts everyone  this is hot news showing that the caisocdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought  i am not sure how to best use this information  but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and fercs attention 1  according to two sources  the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwrs excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caisos supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff  the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caisos surreptitious transactions 2  this sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff  which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first  caiso tariff  dispatch protocol section 862 d  only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy  bids  can the caiso buy out of market oom energy  if the caiso were following the tariff  cdwrs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as 000  therefore  under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs  but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwr 3  by ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power  the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market  low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices  the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as 000  therefore  the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment  its energy would be treated as excess energy  and it would get little or nothing for it 4  while there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first  this behavior clearly benefits davis  absent the caisos purchases of cdwrs excess energy  cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  the media has been been making hay out of daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  therefore  davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts  of course  they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caiso 5  the costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who  frequently seeing 10minute ex post prices of 000  expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to 000  these scs are in for a big surprise  according to one source at sierra pacific  the caiso charged him as much as 400mwh for imbalance energy  where is the price mitigation here 6  who benefits under this scam  davis and cdwr  who loses under this scam  instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy 7  sources  our client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito  an industry insider publication mentioned it also 8  here is the quote from the friday burrito there is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls  thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me  the iso will be billing some drwcers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of  say  15  but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual realtime settlement price there is no way to estimate what the oom charge was as the iso doesnt post that information the implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price this sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the fercs goals of creating open  transparent markets 9  here is

hall used to get it and sent a couple to me  but i havent seen it for a long time also  to recap our telephone discussion  the charges assessed to the market in charge type 487 are determined by cers  and are being collected by the iso on behalf of cers  to cover the cost of contracts that cers has signed for energy purchases and 487 pricingcharges have do direct relationship to the inc and dec

ccdlportland volume mgmt subject487 revelation steve  here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the caiso is handling 487  kent at sierra power inquired to me why he was being charged 487  487 is the charge code the caiso uses when it has to go out of market  and purchase power that exceeds 15000mwh  481 is the charge code they use to credit it back  for the same hours and intervals that both the inc and dec prices were zero  this was obviously very peculiar and nobody in vm knew the answer so caroline posed the question to keoni at the caiso  his response was this  that the caiso is charging 487 regardless of the inc and dec prices  to cover the forward market contracts signed by cdwr and cers  in effect  they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price  and are in effect trying to recover costs for cdwr and cers kit

2538,0, 69 million profit from the west is not much to show for all of the sleeving sempra did for the iso sempras trading unit generates a windfall  by craig d rose staff writer july 27  2001 sempra energy  the parent company of sdge  reported a 25 percent surge in profit to 137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a longterm contract to california on the other hand  sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit  a middleman that earned 69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others the results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets the surprising announcement  that a company lost money selling power during californias runup in electricity prices  was explained by sempra as an intentional consequence of the longterm contract it signed with the state to provide power stephen baum  chairman and chief executive officer of sempra  said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to california during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10year deal california sought longterm electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and nearterm power markets  where prices reached record levels critics say gov gray davis rushed into longterm deals because of concerns about getting through next years election they also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years the governor has acknowledged that longterm contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years  but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy michael shames  executive director of the utility consumers action network in san diego  said the steep discount sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governors proposal to help san diego gas  electric co clear a debt of 750 million sdge says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers in a media conference last month  davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers  who he said might have faced the socalled balancing account debt as early as next year shames says the proposal  which took the form of a memorandum of understanding  or mou  is costly for consumers and a bonanza for sempra he said the relatively cheap power provided by sempra this summer makes the mou sound like more of a hidden payback to sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers shames said he will release an analysis of the states sempra plan next week the state public utilities commission is expected to rule on the plan in august a sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the 750 million debt doug kline  the sempra spokesman  said the power contract with the state was signed in early may and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in midjune sempra energy trading  meanwhile  said only 10 percent of its 69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region  which includes california the trading operation earned 40 million in profit during the comparable period last year californias independent system operator  which manages most of the state power grid  and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the california power crisis though sempra earned money on trading  its wholesale power generating business lost 9 million during the quarter baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for sempra energy resources but added that a plant outage also contributed sempra energy resources  which coowns a generating plant near las vegas with reliant energy  earned 2 million during the second quarter last year baum added that sempras longterm contract with the state  under which it will provide up to 1 900 megawatts  has allowed its wholesale business to presell about half the power it expects to generate from the nevada plant  which will be expanded  and three generating facilities it expects to build profits at sdge slipped to 37 million during the quarter ended june 30  down from 40 million last year  according to sempra sdge  whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity  said it provided increased customer service during the crisis  which lowered profits wall street analysts generally applauded sempras results  noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003 theyre really two years ahead of schedule for their nonutility businesses  said brian youngberg  an analyst with edward jones  co bud leedom  a san diegobased analyst with wells fargo van kasper  said sempras move into energy trading now seems shrewd we never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this  leedom said investors pushed sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday  to close at 2549 in trading on the new york stock exchange

2601,0, after consulting with our california scheduling team to determine why 512 volumes on our spreadsheet were not matching up with yours  i have revised my sheet  and i think youll find this new one more fitting  also  the 51 sheet has been revised slightly  namely  the np15 transmission column daniel  per our conversation this morning  the np15 and sp15 on peak prices happened to be the same on this day  so they are correct as you see them in the sheet please call me with questions thanks  kate 5034647486

2641,0, bob  sorry for the late response  ive been gone the last 10 days i will not be able to make the meeting on june 27 i do like jack dempseys proposal im not sure i completely understand mons reasoning  but i believe the pse submission deadline should be left at 30 minutes for the following 2 reasons 1 3a1 is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and excluding the ramp time if we change it to read 20 minutes prior to start that would allow a tag to be submitted at 40 after 2 if the 20 minutes verbage is to be used  then the the remaining verbage defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will need to be removed it was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the realtime deadline at 30 after however  i still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to the new bps being put forth by the escestf are we going to take into account the bps that the ecsestf have put outbeing commented on the schedule process bp has several rampingtiming changes  as well as frag tags they arent asking whether or not we should adopt eastern connection timelines  theyre just doing it personally  i dont think the majority of the wsccs units can handle a 10 minute ramp  and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts however  that is being proposed i would appreciate someone elses opinion on where the proposed bps fit in with our goal carmine tilghman tucson electric power wholesale marketing 520 7457108
