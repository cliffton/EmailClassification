0,2, traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip   especially if you have to prepare a presentation   i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings   i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary  as far as the business meetings  i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not   too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn    the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format  my suggestion for where to go is austin   play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s   flying somewhere takes too much time

inc   ndin  commented today on the recent announcement by the canadian radio  television and telecommunications commission  crtc  that they would regulate voice over internet protocol  voip  service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service  in its decision   the crtc determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets   the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to stifle competition  the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers   cable companies and virtual operators  the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework   stated jan oliver   ceo of nomad international inc  the key to nomad  s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial  up customers  though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide   dial  up remains the primary source of internet connectivity  in the u  s  alone   there are over 20 o   ooo   0 oo users of the internet  of the total users in the u  s    the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40   oo 0   000   stats by the yankee group  dial  up therefore represents approximately 8 o  of the entire internet connectivity market  the percentage of dial  up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher  nomad  s ability to offer voip products to dial  up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration   but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique   proprietary and easily adaptable product  about nomad international inc  nomad international inc  is a multi  national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol  voip  technologies  the company  s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial  up   broadband   dsl   cable   satellite and wireless capabilities  the company plans on targeting  1  national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace   2  large multinational corporations which need to have us or european presence by having    for example    a united states number ringing in their offices in guatemala or london   offering business partners a more economical way to communicate   and 3  immigrants in north america   a means

103,2, subject message subject think getting a 1  95  rate is impossible  think again  we can offer you the absolute rock  bottom lowest rate   guaranteed  we work with all credit types  visit our site now   for your rate quote  click here now  now that i have had both services   and having noticed that a google search yields no definitive answers for people   i wanted to post my personal review of the two systems  i have an alpine cda  7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit   both with terk antennas  the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca adapter available from alpine  kca  121 b   i had xm since it debuted and sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest  the bottom line   for those needing a quick answer   is sirius is superior in sound quality   features  free streaming from their website     and channel quality  better music   no commercials   better talk   xm has a few more channels that make very little difference to the end result  read on   after careful review of both systems   sirius came out the winnner   as i have said  the channels are laid out well   lack commercials   sound great   and are streamed on the internet  the only disadvantage of sirius was its oft  sited lack of nascar   which they seem to be trying to remedy  also   xm has an extra comedy channel  it  s boring   and features older   censored comedy    and a few more  experimental  music channels which most will find totally useless  surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular  terrestrial  radio in a large city  you get nothing but frustration  it  s no wonder xm doesn  t stream live on the net so that you can try before you buy  also   xm  s channel layout was unfriendly   in my opinion  the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two   however   are the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials  not necessarily the corporate commercials that come from outside companies  which are annoying in an expected way    but the ridiculous and loud in  house xm stuff that makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you  ve had it up loud  especially with the windows open  yes   they are that embarrassing   this   and the better performance of sirius   was the deciding factor in my cancelling xm  xm   however   holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent music and a fair selection of talk  if not for sirius   i would have kept xm   i think  probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no matter where you go  yet   as is the way of competition   sirius has offered everything good that xm does and done it right  sirius outshines in the talk category   with a variety of right and left  wing shows   all of the useful talk channels xm has   and npr   pri   and a well laid  out channel plan  xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website  sirius also has a customer care website   but it is not as robust  less detail   however   xm doesn  t have streaming audio on its website  apparently we all have to pay xm  6  99 extra in additon to buying another  200 receiver for the house  in addition to the crappy commercials   this is probably where the corporate influence of xm being part  owned by clearchannel and gm shows  
104,2, jacques  the agreement looks fine    my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that  the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project     technically  that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required  did i loan them  1 300 000   i thought it was less  regarding exhibit a  the assets include   the land  architectural plans  engineering completed  appraisal  and soils study    most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants   i have been speaking directly to the architect  engineer  and soils engineer    i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants  the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above   do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of  5 875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor  phillip

typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate  or llc  general partner   the general partner owns 1  of the project and carries the liability of construction  land ownership   loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans  land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership   each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans   if the investor s  do not sign on the loans  this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced  all loans for residential construction  that are intended for re sale  are full recourse loans   if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments  the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit  engineering   architectural design  soils tests  surveys  filing fees  legal fees for organization and condominium association formation   and appraisals   unlike many real estate investment programs  none of the

listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing   as an alternative  we can close into a land loan at probably 70  of appraised value   with a land value equal to the purchase price of  680 000 this would mean a land loan of  476 000 with estimated monthly interest payments of  3 966  given a 10  annual interest rate  plus approximately 1 25  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin  the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements  referred to as the  fiscals    this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa   this release will be for 90  of the cost with the remaining 10  released one year after completion   releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction   these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit   as such  they have to be counted as a development cost  even though they are not spent   because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds  the lot improvement loan is typically 75  of the appraised value of a finished lot  which i suspect will be at least  20 000 and potentially as high as  25 000   this would produce a loan amount of   15 000 on  20 000 per lot   with estimated per lot improvement costs of  9 000   fiscals  at  2 000 and the land cost at  8 000   total improved lot cost is  19 000 which means  0 to  4 000 per lot in total equity   the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs   thus  the additional equity for the improvement loan would be  0  184 000    even if the maximum loan would cover all costs  it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side   the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing  which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement  phasing works as follows   if the first phase was say 40 units  the total lot improvement cost might average  31 000 per lot    of this  probably  13 000 would be for improvements and  19 000 for the land cost   the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs  the entry road  water treatment costs  perimeter fencing and landscaping  and so on  as well as for 100  of the land   the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70  of the appraised raw lot value  which i would estimate as  10 000 per lot for a loan value of  7 000 per lot   then the loan value for each improved lot would be  15 000 per lot   this would give you a total loan of  992 000  total cost of  1 232 645 for equity required of  241 000   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans   first  is a speculative  spec  loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity   second   is a construction loan for a pre sold unit  but the loan remains in the builder developers name   third  is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer   we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer   we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers  as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process  spec loans will be for 70  to 75  of value and construction loans for pre sold units  if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender   will be from 80  to 95  of value  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs  then to necessary reserves  then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement   the general partner will contract with creekside builders  llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15  of the direct hard cost excluding land  financing and sales costs  these fees are the only monies to creekside  larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit  except for a  direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b  direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform   for example  if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub  or cannot find enough trim carpenters  etc   and it decides to undertake this function  it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership  finally  cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others   at present cb does not own any significant equipment  but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing  cornice  roofing and drywall spreading  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs  plan  what did you

please expand  investor input we are glad to have the investor s input on design and materials   as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement  but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus  as you  and i presume keith  want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs  vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates   in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible   for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport   finally  for vendors they are constantly shopped  pre selected professionals  subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested  i know i have not answered everything  but this is a starting point   call when you have reviewed and we can

originally published wednesday  los angeles  dow jones   the california independent system operator paid about  10 million wednesday for 1 000 megawatts of power from powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state  high ranking market sources familiar with the iso s operation told dow jones newswires  but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day  the iso wouldn t comment on the transactions  saying it is sensitive market information  but sources said powerex  a subsidiary of british columbia hydro   power authority  x bch   is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about  900 a megawatt hour from the early afternoon through the evening  but that still wasn t enough juice  the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso 1 200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of  250 mwh  the ladwp  which is not governed by the iso  needs 3 800 megawatts of power to serve its customers  it is free sell power instate above the  250 mwh price cap  the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare  the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high  however  the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging  the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration  which sells hydropower at cheap rates  back into the market at prices 10 times higher  powerex officials wouldn t comment on the iso power sale  saying all transactions are proprietary  but the company also sold the iso 1 000 megawatts tuesday   minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts   for  1 100 a megawatt hour  market sources said  the iso  whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost  started the day with a stage two power emergency  which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5   the iso is having to compete with investor owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps  the iso warned federal regulators  generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage three power emergency wednesday  but wouldn t order rolling blackouts  a stage three is declared when the iso s operating reserves fall to less than 1 5  and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing  but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources   in order to line up  more power  we have to be in a dire situation   dorinson said  edison international unit  eix  southern california edison  sempra energy unit  sre  san diego gas   electric  pg e corp   pcg  unit pacific gas   electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high priced power  socal edison and pg e are facing a debt of more than  6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs  the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly  1 billion  analysts said  it s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs   by jason leopold  dow jones newswires  323 658 3874  jason leopold dowjones com  end  dow jones newswires 07 12 00

according to the iso  the iso manages grid reliability  as previously reported  the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power

officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons  the california independent system operator  which manages the state s power grid and one of its wholesale power markets  and the california public utilities commission began on site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns  iso spokesman pat dorinson said  the state has had 11 000 mw off the grid since monday  7 000 mw for unplanned maintenance  the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day  meaning power reserves were below 5  and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so  as reported earlier  reliant energy  rei  and southern energy inc   soe  said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening  representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening  aes told the visitors they couldn t perform an unannounced full inspection of the company s 450 megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning  when the plant s full staff would be present  aes spokesman aaron thomas said  thomas  as well as an iso spokesman  didn t know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection  aes units down due to expired emissions credits the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide  or nox  emission credits  they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed  thomas said  aes has about 2 000 mw  or half its maximum output  off line  the entire huntington plant is off line  as is 1 500 mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants  the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations  but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company  20 million for polluting   we d be happy to put our units back  provided we don t get sued for it   thomas said   it s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district s  authority  as reported  a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies  but choose not to do so  dynegy s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc   dyn  said the puc visited its 1 200 mw el

take a look for yourself  that s fine    said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky  lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps  which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired   we ve been doing all we can to get back in service   lednicky said   we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited   lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy s explanation of why its units were off line   by jessica berthold  dow jones newswires  323 658 3872  jessica berthold dowjones com  end  dow

corporation  tirr  finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing on 35 bpd in production    readers who have followed oil stock recommendations  otcbb  svse and asurf  in the past have profited nicely  the company tradestar corp   otc  tirr    is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re  entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america  new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over 90   tradestar corp  is engaged in the low  risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth  the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling   completion and production techniques   have resulted in  1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area  2 co  mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well   increasing both initial and total output  3 the opportunity to drill new offset wells   where success rates are typically over 90    using oil   35  00 and gas   4  50   the pay back on well re  entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months  oil is currently  48 and gas  6     tirr  s strategy is to strike oil again  using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk   high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays  barnett shale in central texas  in the lower 48 states    with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties   an aggressive acquisition campaign   experienced management team   and application of cutting edge ep technologies   we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio  investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy prices  these high energy prices have created new opportunities to bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk to the company     previous news tradestar corporation announces barnett

drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county   texas  in addition to the gas well reentry   the prospect   which covers 111 acres   has an additional location to drill a new well  the objective formation of the recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of approximately 4   830  to 5   030  with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone  estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750   000 mcf for each well  why we love this stock 1  continued rise in world oil gas prices  2  over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific barnett shale of central texas 3  strong industry investment banking relationships 4  strong management  over 50 years of experience in the oil patch 5  multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners 6  tight float   low entry price strong upward potential  7  business model offers only real solution to u  s  dependency on foreign oil  8  the company recently proposed a joint venture project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with est  reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas  conclusion tradestar corp   tirr  is getting ready to become a major presence in oil gas fields across texas  tirr  s potential for large  scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the barnett shale   position the stock for immediate upward movement    we believe that tirr is in position to take the petroleum industry by storm  the company  s resource development is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in the near future  revenues are

report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance bridge loan by the may 8th deadline    any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart   according to sources  both the republic  ans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis   the democratic cauc  us is reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis   many legislative republic  ans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that  o  nce the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund  davis would  double  dip  into the fund   clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg  islature and the governor   however  it is believed once davis discloses th  e details of the power contracts negotiated  a bond issuance will take plac  e   additionally  some generator sources have reported that some of the lon  g term power contracts  as opposed to those still in development  require t  hat the bond issuance happen by july 1  2001   if not  the state may be in   breach of contract   sources state that if the legislature does not pass th  e bridge loan legislation by may 8th  having a bond issuance by july 1st wi  ll be very difficult  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat  e would  eat  the  5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund  thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately    8 billion   however  the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this   concession   sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for ful  l disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis  including the   details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated  before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward  currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan  ab 8x and ab   31x   ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  10 billion in bonds   this bi  ll passed the senate in march  but has stalled in the assembly due to a lac  k of republican support   ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs fo  r community college districts   however  sources report this bill may be am  ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen  curre  ntly in ab 8x   senator  bowen s language states that the state should get   paid before the utilities from rate payments  which  if passed  would be li  kely to cause a socal  bankruptcy   20  20 according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature  republic  ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in   the general fund   for instance  tony  strickland has stated that only 1 2   of the bonds  or approximately  5 billion   should be issued   other republ  icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds   the republicans intend  to bring this up in debate on  monday   additionally  lehman brothers repo  rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind  ications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan   20 key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount  09 4 125 b lenders  09 09jp morgan 09 09 2 5 b  09 09 09lehman brothers 09 09 1 0 b  09 09 09bear stearns 09 09

09 095 38  maturity date  09 09august 29  2001 for more details please contact me at  713  853 9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday  but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday  which authorizes  5  billion to create t  he california consumer power and conservation  authority     the  5 billion  authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the  5 billion that must be aut  horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased  or the addi  tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power   going forward   again  the republicans are not in support of these authoriz  ations   without the details of the long term power contracts the governor   has  negotiated  the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is   that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support    no f  urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it   is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas  ing power     also  there is no staff  defined purpose  etc  for  the calif  ornia public power and conservation authority   however  this can  be consi  dered a victory for consumer advocates  who began promoting this idea  earl  ier in the crisis   20 socal edison and bankruptcy at this point  two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy   t  he first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the   governor   the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is au  gust 15th  however  some decision will likely be made earlier   according t  o sources  the state has yet to sign the mou with socal  though socal has s  igned it   the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davi  s and the senate lack the votes needed to pass   if the legislature indicat  es that it will not pas the mou  socal would likely file for voluntary bank  ruptcy  or its creditor   involuntary  due to the lack operating cash   20 the second likely triggering event  which is linked directly to the bond is  suance  would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x  bridge loan  s  tating that the dwr would received 100  of its payments from ratepayers  th  en the utilities would receive the residual amount   in other words  the st  ate will get paid before the utilities   if this language is included and p  assed by the legislature  it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy   socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments

367,2, subject market watch undervalued report f april 2004 top pick of the month life energy and technology holdings   inc   otcbb  leth  leth receives  250   000   000 in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste  to  energy units in the united states  first unit to roll  out in new orleans in early second quarter  we are expecting earth  shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over  100 million in sales orders in the past year   and tops that record  setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of  8  62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion    our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick   ushg featured at  75 reached 3  65 in 8 days  traded as high as 7  00 since  the biosphere process system  soaring worldwide demand  leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem  this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean   green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste   agricultural wastes   forestry wastes   medical wastes   industrial wastes   sewage sludge   shale oil   sour natural gas   and the huge market of used tires  leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega  watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid  the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost  effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste  leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures  financing of  250 million positions leth for astronomical sales  the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this  1  50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to  8  62 per common share in cash  there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide  the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres  now factor in that the average sale price is  7 million per biosphere  we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential  700   000   000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding  leth stock guidance  current price  1  80 near  term target  4  80 projected high for  04  12  50 leth  s blue chip partner  fortifying the system  leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech   inc   nasdaq  ttek    21  a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental   mechanical   and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of  800 million  tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits   installation   and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth  tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana  this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near  term announcement  political power fosters rapid global expansion  leth has captured the profit  making attention of both us and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources  this has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from dr  albert reynolds   chairman of leth   who is also the former prime minister of ireland  dr  reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market  uncommon value for a company of this caliber  we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere   the impressive backlog of over  100 million in sales orders   and the company  s very solid financial position  we view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company  s own sales records  as our top stock pick for april   we anticipate the continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite leth shares which carry our highest rating for short  term trading profits followed by robust long  term capital gains  top pick of the month cautions that small and micro  cap stocks are high  risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost  we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock  all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of top pick

377,2, vishal resigned today 
378,2, subject personal contact dear sir  madam   you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally  the purpose of my mail is that i am mr  peter stevens   the second son of dr  dennis stevens   who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe  i am writing from holland  the netherlands  where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker  before the death of my father   he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of  us  18  9 m  eighteen million   nine hundred thousand united states dollars only   in a private security and finance company  may be he for  saw the looming danger in zimbabwe  but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company  this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland  the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe   introduced a new land use decree  act that   affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks  this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society   so to say  infact   a lot of people were killed in this land reform act   including my father  it is against this back  ground   that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands   forbids a refugee  asylum seeker  to have such a money in an account  i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction  i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because  i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history  moreover   the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers  i must let you know that this transaction is risk free  if you accept to assist me and my family   you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide  this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice  i have two options of offers for your assistance  you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon   or you may decide to have 20  of the total sum   70  will be for me and my family and the remaining 10  will be set aside for un  forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end  you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is   about this proposal  please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction  thank for your anticipated co  operations  peter stevens

422,2, subject  otcbb  itst  up 38    uregent news alert urgent news alert stock profile press release international telephone services  its  is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients  its started off offering a call  back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol  south of spain    then extending this to businesses also based in the area  as of december 1998   when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain   its focused its efforts on providing a made  to  measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality  the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls   prepaid calling cards   and intelligent numbers  90 x   800  type   with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000   its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain  unfortunately   the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot  com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector  by the end of 2001   its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to  ride out the storm   by january 2002   actual shareholders   not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time   and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain   decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value  as of the end of march   its  new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america  since this time   the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales  these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project  in addition   the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide  some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its   installed   maintained and supported by its   thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors  some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain  another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid   spain  s telecoms center  the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders  as such   its is  1  building very little  owned  infrastructure for commodity services   utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators  2  investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services  3  investing in optimising its commercial dimensions  the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners   such as  corte ingles   respol  petrol stations  and carrefour  220 stores   the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain   including 1   000 post offices  the company has pending contracts with a u  s  military base in spain   15 adventure and marine parks   and a large chain of convenience

443,2, traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip  especially if you have to prepare a presentation   i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings   i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary  as far as the business meetings  i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not   too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn    the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format  my suggestion for where to go is austin   play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s   flying somewhere takes too much time

undervalued and has just started trading  ground floor opportunity for everybody  this small treasure is  gbic  gulf biomedical corp  the stock is trading at only 20 cents and we expect it will hit 50  60 cents in the second week of april huge pr campaign expected this week so grab as much as you can up to 45  55 cents range                                  stock symbol  gbic current price   0  19 we expect the price to go to 50  60 cents in next 2  3 days we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks                                   there are some very positive news expected next week so act before that   about the company  60  million americans are losing  or have already lost  their hair  they are mostly men   but also a substantial number of women  most of that 60  milloin wish they had it back  gulf biomedical corporation  gbic  has a breakthrough product that will help them  no   it will really help them  there are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing   until you read the fine print  the fine print says    this doesn  t work for everybody   it says    results may take four months or more to appear   it says    beware of the side effects   it says    a long term contract is required   gbic has hairmagict  there is no fine print  hairmagict says   plain and simple   hairmagict grows hair  easily  painlessly  inexpensively  for less than  2 a day  results in 4 weeks   or your money back                                    stock symbol  gbic current price   0  19 we expect the price to go to 50  60 cents in next 2  3 days we expect the

million american men and women  yes   women too  are losing  or have already lost  their hair  most of them would give anything to have it back  people do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really don  t  funny  sure   if you have a full head of hair  if you don  t   you would probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your head  that  s what the experts call a  market   now   you  ve seen all the ads  they are full of hair  growing promises   plus warnings that their product doesn  t work for everybody   and beware of the side effects  one promises the buyer will see results   if any   in four months  all of them cost a veritable fortune  now   finally   there  s a hair  growing product that actually grows hair   and hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less   or give you a 100  refund  and   incredibly   hairmagictsells for less than  2 a day                                   stock symbol  gbic current

perlman hou ect ect subject  consolidated positions  issues   to do list phillip  below is the issues   to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical financial positions and transport trade capture  what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan s list  the need for a single set of requirements  although the meeting with keith  on wednesday   was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen  will be extremely difficult and time consuming   throughout the meeting on wednesday  keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position  so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking  much like excel   what needs to happen on monday from 3   5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen  this is critical  this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future  but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements  also  to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical financial positions and transport trade capture  the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves  and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project  i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good  i believe there has been good communication between the teams  but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve  richard                        forwarded by richard burchfield hou ect on 10 06 2000 08 34 am                             allan severude 10

list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions  i think we still have the following issues  we don t have a single point of contact from the trading group   we ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders   we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements  we re getting hit with a lot of different requests  many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation  things left to do  i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we re trying to accomplish with this project   it ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope  go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope  for those in scope  work to define relative importance  priority  of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each  define the desired lay out of the position manager screen  main view and all drill downs  use the above to formulate a project plan  things requested thus far  no particular order   inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker  customized rows and columns in the position manager  ad hoc rows columns that add up existing position manager rows columns   new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by  physical  transport  swaps  options      addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real time values of all curves on which the desk has a position  ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions   each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid  ability to properly show curve shift for float for float deals  determine the appropriate positions to show for each  gas daily for monthly index  physical gas for nymex  physical gas for inside ferc  physical gas for mid market  ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations  position and p l aggregation across all gas desks  ability to include the gas price book into tds  inclusion of spread options in our systems   ability to handle volatility skew and correlations  ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day  approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid  valuation of gas daily options  a new position screen for options  months x strike x delta    tbd  inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets  ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager  ability to view change deal p l in the tds deal ticker   show new deal terms  prior deal terms  and net p l affect of the change  eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the tds deal ticker  position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell  benchmark positions in tds  deployment of tds in canada  currency and volume uom conversions  implicit and explicit position break out issues     allan  ps  colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport   hopefully we ll know much better where that part stands at that point

570,2, scott  i emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company   i think i know the answer to your questions but i want to get the exact details from him   basically  they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider   then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit  the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk   this is my best guess   i will get back to you with more  phillip

perlman hou ect ect subject  consolidated positions  issues   to do list phillip  below is the issues   to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical financial positions and transport trade capture  what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan s list  the need for a single set of requirements  although the meeting with keith  on wednesday   was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen  will be extremely difficult and time consuming   throughout the meeting on wednesday  keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position  so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking  much like excel   what needs to happen on monday from 3   5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen  this is critical  this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future  but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements  also  to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical financial positions and transport trade capture  the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves  and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project  i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good  i believe there has been good communication between the teams  but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve  richard                        forwarded by richard burchfield hou ect on 10 06 2000 08 34 am                             allan severude 10 05 2000 06 03 pm to  richard burchfield hou ect ect cc  peggy alix hou ect ect  russ severson hou ect ect  scott mills hou ect ect  kenny ha hou ect ect subject  consolidated positions  issues   to do list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions  i think we still have the following issues  we don t have a single point of contact from the trading group   we ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders   we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements  we re getting hit with a lot of different requests  many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation  things left to do  i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we re trying to accomplish with this project   it ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope  go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope  for those in scope  work to define relative importance  priority  of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each  define the desired lay out of the position manager screen  main view and all drill downs  use the above to formulate a project plan  things requested thus far  no particular order   inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker  customized rows and columns in the position manager  ad hoc rows columns that add up existing position manager rows columns   new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by  physical  transport  swaps  options      addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real time values of all curves on which the desk has a position  ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions   each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid  ability to properly show curve shift for float for float deals  determine the appropriate positions to show for each  gas daily for monthly index  physical gas for nymex  physical gas for inside ferc  physical gas for mid market  ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations  position and p l aggregation across all gas desks  ability to include the gas price book into tds  inclusion of spread options in our systems   ability to handle volatility skew and correlations  ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day  approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid  valuation of gas daily options  a new position screen for options  months x strike x delta    tbd  inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets  ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager  ability to view change deal p l in the tds deal ticker   show new deal terms  prior deal terms  and net p l affect of the change  eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the tds deal ticker  position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell  benchmark positions in tds  deployment of tds in canada  currency and volume uom conversions  implicit and explicit position break out issues     allan  ps  colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport   hopefully we ll know much better where that part stands at that point

getting the exact same equipment   with original manufacturers warranty at a much lower price  q  what is considered factory refurbished  a  there are lots of things that can label items factory refurbished  some are so frivolous   its laughable  but because consumer laws prevent manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished as  new    the second consumer gets the best deal  here are a few examples  manufacturers  distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory  country  to avoid  disturbing  the dealer  reseller channel in different countries   manufacturers and distributors cannot export the product   as new and therefore label it as refurb  most major retail superstores offer a 30  day money back guarantee on their products and there are those consumers that just simply take advantage of that  these items are returned to the manufacturer   inspected and repackaged like new  items where the box or casing was damaged in shipment   which are returned to the manufacturer  the item was returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect  the part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer   tested and then repackaged just like new  the item was returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that was corrected  demonstration units are also considered factory refurbished  these units are inspected   tested and repackaged  the box was simply opened  thats it  brand new overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished  all factory refurbished products are inspected serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product specifications  all merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer  your one stop distributorjebel ali duty free zonedubai   uae  www  computron

typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate  or llc  general partner   the general partner owns 1  of the project and carries the liability of construction  land ownership   loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans  land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership   each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans   if the investor s  do not sign on the loans  this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced  all loans for residential construction  that are intended for re sale  are full recourse loans   if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments  the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit  engineering   architectural design  soils tests  surveys  filing fees  legal fees for organization and condominium association formation   and appraisals   unlike many real estate investment programs  none of the

listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing   as an alternative  we can close into a land loan at probably 70  of appraised value   with a land value equal to the purchase price of  680 000 this would mean a land loan of  476 000 with estimated monthly interest payments of  3 966  given a 10  annual interest rate  plus approximately 1 25  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin  the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements  referred to as the  fiscals    this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa   this release will be for 90  of the cost with the remaining 10  released one year after completion   releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction   these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit   as such  they have to be counted as a development cost  even though they are not spent   because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds  the lot improvement loan is typically 75  of the appraised value of a finished lot  which i suspect will be at least  20 000 and potentially as high as  25 000   this would produce a loan amount of   15 000 on  20 000 per lot   with estimated per lot improvement costs of  9 000   fiscals  at  2 000 and the land cost at  8 000   total improved lot cost is  19 000 which means  0 to  4 000 per lot in total equity   the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs   thus  the additional equity for the improvement loan would be  0  184 000    even if the maximum loan would cover all costs  it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side   the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing  which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement  phasing works as follows   if the first phase was say 40 units  the total lot improvement cost might average  31 000 per lot    of this  probably  13 000 would be for improvements and  19 000 for the land cost   the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs  the entry road  water treatment costs  perimeter fencing and landscaping  and so on  as well as for 100  of the land   the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70  of the appraised raw lot value  which i would estimate as  10 000 per lot for a loan value of  7 000 per lot   then the loan value for each improved lot would be  15 000 per lot   this would give you a total loan of  992 000  total cost of  1 232 645 for equity required of  241 000   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans   first  is a speculative  spec  loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity   second   is a construction loan for a pre sold unit  but the loan remains in the builder developers name   third  is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer   we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer   we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers  as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process  spec loans will be for 70  to 75  of value and construction loans for pre sold units  if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender   will be from 80  to 95  of value  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs  then to necessary reserves  then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement   the general partner will contract with creekside builders  llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15  of the direct hard cost excluding land  financing and sales costs  these fees are the only monies to creekside  larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit  except for a  direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b  direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform   for example  if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub  or cannot find enough trim carpenters  etc   and it decides to undertake this function  it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership  finally  cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others   at present cb does not own any significant equipment  but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing  cornice  roofing and drywall spreading  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs  plan  what did you have in mind   i would like to use some form of internet based reporting  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question   bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses    please expand  investor input we are glad to have the investor s input on design and materials   as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement  but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus  as you  and i presume keith  want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs  vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates   in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible   for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport   finally  for vendors they are constantly shopped  pre selected professionals  subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested  i know i have not answered everything  but this is a starting point   call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further  sincerely  george richards president  creekside builders  llc   winmail dat

assistance  it is the intention of abdv to build a portfolio of companies in diverse industries  vkdqkgxdjmtnnh companies under abdvyyhtxnv e  direct inc  knfbdcv fine wein records   inc  jbwfldy from actual press releases  yjycunv red bank   n  j    aug 24   2004  primezone via comtex    the following is a letter from john figliolini   president of atlantis business development corporation   inc   otcbb    ldgkcpf dear shareholder   addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading  up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market  our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv  fine wein records is an example of that  with a financial commitment of  250   000 by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the various projects they are currently working on  e  direct is another example  we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next 12 months  however   abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus  as of today that has changed  wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing  1   000   000 in equity financing to future quest   inc   pink sheets     a company in the oil gas sector   this was the start of our new direction  abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial   accounting and financing for companies in the energy field   from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies  jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask  why the energy related field  simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching  50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector  according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of  73 from the 1970 s  however   unlike the oil crisis of the past   we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time  simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2  5  this year alone   most of which is because of china  the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the  20  30 level  we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone  there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels  abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field  these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities  wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non  energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e  direct  well   first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own  i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now  at that point i will recommend to abdv  s board of directors that we spin  off these two businesses to our shareholders  this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies  we can then continue to concentrate in the energy  related field  lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv  s purpose and guide it like a laser  our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy  related businesses over the next 12 months  i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy  related fields  twqssqlqqkvbdm

1109,2, subject impact equity report mineral exploration stockp delta mining and exploration corp  otc  dmxpp controls 6 properties totaling 7   554 acres  approximately 11 sq  miles  in montana  another 10   000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia   south america   source  company website  currently trading at  012 p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week  pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock  p  otcbb  mbah   this stock closed at  01 on september lst  this little giant closed at  06 on october 8 th   up 500  in about 5 weeks  do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon  p as many of you may agree   some   not all   of these stocks move in price because they are promoted   making a very large number of investors aware of the stock  the awareness is underway on dmxp  pp let  s look at the company   delta mining and exploration corp  otc  dmxpp about the company  p delta mining and exploration corp  otc  dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7   554 acres  approximately 11 sq  miles  in montana  the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states  another 10   000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia   south america  initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america  p the management team is led by chief executive officer   dr  barry rayment   who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level  dr  rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology   along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry  dr  rayment was the president of bema gold corp     amex  bgo    a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars  he was also affiliated with glamis gold   gold fields mining and amselco exploration  bp minerals    among others  his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward  p among the support team is stephen kay   a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe   south africa   south america and the united states  while with gold fields mining corp    stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california  p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start  up in 1997  for example   delta has discovered the first in  situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite   southeast of lewistown  the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals  a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds  including pyrope  garnet    chromite and clinoprroxene  p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under  explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta   canada  p in bolivia   delta controls approximately two  thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7   860 acres  12 sq miles   the other one  third is presently being explored by de beers  in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2   000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified  p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties  delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration  p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls   they also control a gold property with great potential  the property is near la paz in bolivia   where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program  pp  source  company website  p recent headlines  go online and read the full stories  p delta mining and exploration corp  is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce  p delta mining and exploration corp  visits homestead property in preparation of work program  p delta mining and exploration corp  discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america  p delta mining and exploration   corp  looks to continue diamond exploration in south america  pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend and next week  if you think so   you may not want to wait until it is too late  remember   timing your trade is critical  good luck and happy trading

1139,2, jaques  after meeting with george and larry  it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit   their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials   then there is a layer of  construction management  fees of 10    there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money   but i think the majority of it is profit   finally the builders profit of 1 4 million  keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit   after all  if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors  we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10  fee in addition to the superintendent costs   george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using   i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don t think the construction management fee is included  george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard   i will review and let you know what i think  the gp issues don t seem to be a point of contention   they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process  let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for  only true costs   1 4 million  phillip

typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate  or llc  general partner   the general partner owns 1  of the project and carries the liability of construction  land ownership   loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans  land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership   each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans   if the investor s  do not sign on the loans  this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced  all loans for residential construction  that are intended for re sale  are full recourse loans   if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments  the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit  engineering   architectural design  soils tests  surveys  filing fees  legal fees for organization and condominium association formation   and appraisals   unlike many real estate investment programs  none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders  llc   these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period  early land costs the  4 000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing   as an alternative  we can close into a land loan at probably 70  of appraised value   with a land value equal to the purchase price of  680 000 this would mean a land loan of  476 000 with estimated monthly interest payments of  3 966  given a 10  annual interest rate  plus approximately 1 25  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin  the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements  referred to as the  fiscals    this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa   this release will be for 90  of the cost with the remaining 10  released one year after completion   releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction   these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit   as such  they have to be counted as a development cost  even though they are not spent   because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds  the lot improvement loan is typically 75  of the appraised value of a finished lot  which i suspect will be at least  20 000 and potentially as high as  25 000   this would produce a loan amount of   15 000 on  20 000 per lot   with estimated per lot improvement costs of  9 000   fiscals  at  2 000 and the land cost at  8 000   total improved lot cost is  19 000 which means  0 to  4 000 per lot in total equity   the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs   thus  the additional equity for the improvement loan would be  0  184 000    even if the maximum loan would cover all costs  it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side   the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing  which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement  phasing works as follows   if the first phase was say 40 units  the total lot improvement cost might average  31 000 per lot    of this  probably  13 000 would be for improvements and  19 000 for the land cost   the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs  the entry road  water treatment costs  perimeter fencing and landscaping  and so on  as well as for 100  of the land   the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70  of the appraised raw lot value  which i would estimate as  10 000 per lot for a loan value of  7 000 per lot   then the loan value for each improved lot would be  15 000 per lot   this would give you a total loan of  992 000  total cost of  1 232 645 for equity required of  241 000   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans   first  is a speculative  spec  loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity   second   is a construction loan for a pre sold unit  but the loan remains in the builder developers name   third  is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer   we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer   we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers  as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process  spec loans will be for 70  to 75  of value and construction loans for pre sold units  if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender   will be from 80  to 95  of value  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs  then to necessary reserves  then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement   the general partner will contract with creekside builders  llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15  of the direct hard cost excluding land  financing and sales costs  these fees are the only monies to creekside  larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit  except for a  direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b  direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform   for example  if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub  or cannot find enough trim carpenters  etc   and it decides to undertake this function  it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership  finally  cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others   at present cb does not own any significant equipment  but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing  cornice  roofing and drywall spreading  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs  plan  what did you have in mind   i would like to use some form of internet based reporting  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question   bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses    please expand  investor input we are glad to have the investor s input on design and materials   as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement  but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus  as you  and i presume keith  want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs  vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates   in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible   for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport   finally  for vendors they are constantly shopped  pre selected professionals  subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested  i know i have not answered everything  but this is a starting point   call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further  sincerely  george richards president  creekside builders  llc   winmail dat

perlman hou ect ect subject  consolidated positions  issues   to do list phillip  below is the issues   to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical financial positions and transport trade capture  what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan s list  the need for a single set of requirements  although the meeting with keith  on wednesday   was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen  will be extremely difficult and time consuming   throughout the meeting on wednesday  keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position  so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking  much like excel   what needs to happen on monday from 3   5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen  this is critical  this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future  but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements  also  to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical financial positions and transport trade capture  the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves  and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project  i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good  i believe there has been good communication between the teams  but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve  richard                        forwarded by richard burchfield hou ect on 10 06 2000 08 34 am                             allan severude 10

list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions  i think we still have the following issues  we don t have a single point of contact from the trading group   we ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders   we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements  we re getting hit with a lot of different requests  many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation  things left to do  i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we re trying to accomplish with this project   it ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope  go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope  for those in scope  work to define relative importance  priority  of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each  define the desired lay out of the position manager screen  main view and all drill downs  use the above to formulate a project plan  things requested thus far  no particular order   inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker  customized rows and columns in the position manager  ad hoc rows columns that add up existing position manager rows columns   new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by  physical  transport  swaps  options      addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real time values of all curves on which the desk has a position  ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions   each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid  ability to properly show curve shift for float for float deals  determine the appropriate positions to show for each  gas daily for monthly index  physical gas for nymex  physical gas for inside ferc  physical gas for mid market  ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations  position and p l aggregation across all gas desks  ability to include the gas price book into tds  inclusion of spread options in our systems   ability to handle volatility skew and correlations  ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day  approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid  valuation of gas daily options  a new position screen for options  months x strike x delta    tbd  inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets  ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager  ability to view change deal p l in the tds deal ticker   show new deal terms  prior deal terms  and net p l affect of the change  eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the tds deal ticker  position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell  benchmark positions in tds  deployment of tds in canada  currency and volume uom conversions  implicit and explicit position break out issues     allan  ps  colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport   hopefully we ll know much better where that part stands at that point

1344,2, george  i am back in the office and ready to focus on the project   i still have the concerns that i had last week   specifically that the costs of our project are too high   i have gathered more information that support my concerns  based on my research  i believe the project should cost around  10 5 million   the components are as follows  unit cost  site work    builders profit  52 sf     7 6 million land      1 15 interim financing      85 common areas        80 total      10 4 since reagan s last 12 units are selling for around  190 000  i am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over  95 000 unit in costs  also  the comps used in the appraisal from austin appear to be class a properties   it seems unlikely that student housing in san marcos can produce the same rent or sales price   there should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property   i recognize that sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and   foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas  however  we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis   supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance  after the real estate expert from houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates  his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic   he feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around  9 8 million  we would not even be able to cover the interim financing  keith and i have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above  10 5 million  we would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives  phillip

perlman hou ect ect subject  consolidated positions  issues   to do list phillip  below is the issues   to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical financial positions and transport trade capture  what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan s list  the need for a single set of requirements  although the meeting with keith  on wednesday   was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen  will be extremely difficult and time consuming   throughout the meeting on wednesday  keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position  so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking  much like excel   what needs to happen on monday from 3   5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen  this is critical  this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future  but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements  also  to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical financial positions and transport trade capture  the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves  and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project  i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good  i believe there has been good communication between the teams  but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve  richard                        forwarded by richard burchfield hou ect on 10 06 2000 08 34 am                             allan severude 10

list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions  i think we still have the following issues  we don t have a single point of contact from the trading group   we ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders   we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements  we re getting hit with a lot of different requests  many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation  things left to do  i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we re trying to accomplish with this project   it ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope  go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope  for those in scope  work to define relative importance  priority  of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each  define the desired lay out of the position manager screen  main view and all drill downs  use the above to formulate a project plan  things requested thus far  no particular order   inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker  customized rows and columns in the position manager  ad hoc rows columns that add up existing position manager rows columns   new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by  physical  transport  swaps  options      addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real time values of all curves on which the desk has a position  ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions   each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid  ability to properly show curve shift for float for float deals  determine the appropriate positions to show for each  gas daily for monthly index  physical gas for nymex  physical gas for inside ferc  physical gas for mid market  ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations  position and p l aggregation across all gas desks  ability to include the gas price book into tds  inclusion of spread options in our systems   ability to handle volatility skew and correlations  ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day  approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid  valuation of gas daily options  a new position screen for options  months x strike x delta    tbd  inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets  ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager  ability to view change deal p l in the tds deal ticker   show new deal terms  prior deal terms  and net p l affect of the change  eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the tds deal ticker  position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell  benchmark positions in tds  deployment of tds in canada  currency and volume uom conversions  implicit and explicit position break out issues     allan  ps  colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport   hopefully we ll know much better where that part stands at that point

ect ect  suresh vasan enron communications enron communications enron cc  subject  internet data gain is a major power drain on local utilities   september 05  2000   in 1997  a little known silicon valley company called exodus communications opened a 15 000 square foot data center in tukwila  the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the region s growing number of dot coms  fast forward to summer 2000  exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new 13 acre  576 000 square foot data center less than a mile from its original facility  sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones  the exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house internet servers for firms such as avenue a  microsoft and onvia com  exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle  more than a dozen companies    with names like abovenet  globix and hostpro    are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the internet economy  it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites  data centers  also known as co location facilities and server farms  are sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24 hour  high security facilities   we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall   said karl karzmar  manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy   that is the equivalent of six oil refineries   a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business  the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads  puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers  the tariff is designed to protect the company s existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects  those base stations could cost as much as  20 million each  karzmar said  not to be left behind  seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting  for the utilities that provide power to homes  businesses and schools in the region  this is a new and complex issue  on one hand  the data centers    with their amazing appetite for power    represent potentially lucrative business customers  the facilities run 24 hours a day  seven days a week  and therefore could become a constant revenue stream  on the other hand  they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures  who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate   these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads   said bob royer  director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light   the entire university of washington  from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school  averages 31 megawatts per day  we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30  40 and 50 megawatts   with more than 1 5 million square feet  the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers  sabey corp  re purchased the 1 35 million square foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space   defense  in less than 12 months  the developer has leased 92 percent of the six building complex to seven different co location companies   it is probably the largest data center park in the country   boasts laurent poole  chief operating officer at sabey  exodus  icg communications  netstream communications  pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park  after building exodus  first tukwila facility in 1997  sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles  spokane and denver  poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country  as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth heavy tasks such as listening to online music  poole said the need for co location space in seattle continues to escalate  but it is not just seattle  the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country  causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california  exodus  one of the largest providers of co location space  plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year  while companies such as amazon com run their own server farms  many high tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management   we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months   yet there is more demand right now than data center space   said steve porter  an account executive at exodus in seattle  the booming market for co location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed   it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth   said seattle city light s royer   the utility industry is almost stunned by this  in a way

1453,2, scott  i emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company   i think i know the answer to your questions but i want to get the exact details from him   basically  they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider   then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit  the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk   this is my best guess   i will get back to you with more  phillip

1494,2, by steve everly   the kansas city star date  01 20 01 22 15 as natural gas prices rose in december  traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number  the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas  and the forecast was for frigid weather  traders put the two together  anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights   traders do that all the time  they re looking forward   said william burson  a trader   it makes the market for natural gas   but the market s response perplexed chris mcgill  the american gas association s director of gas supply and transportation  he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994  and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality   it s a little frustrating that they don t take the time to understand what we are reporting   mcgill said  as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills  the hunt for reasons    and culprits    is on  some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street  stephen adik  senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource  recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market s speculators for the rise in gas prices   it s my firm belief     that today s gas prices are being manipulated   adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly  in california  where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis  six investigations are looking into the power industry  closer to home  observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter s startling gas bills  having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes  most utilities  often with the acquiescence of regulators  failed to take precautions such as fixed rate contracts and hedging    a sort of price insurance    that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared   we re passing on our gas costs  which we have no control over   said paul snider  a spokesman for missouri gas energy  but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers   there s been a failure of risk management by utilities  and that needs to change   said ed krapels  director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc   an energy consulting firm in wakefield  mass  hot topic consumers know one thing for certain  their heating bills are up sharply  in many circles  little else is discussed  the rev  vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a  1 456 december bill for heating the church    more than double the previous december s bill  church members are suffering from higher bills as well  the sunday collection is down  said fraser  who might have to forgo part of his salary  for the first time  the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating   it s the talk of the town here   he said  a year ago that wasn t a fear  wholesale gas prices hovered just above  2 per thousand cubic feet    a level that producers say didn t make it worthwhile to drill for gas  utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers  but trouble was brewing  by spring  gas prices were hitting  4 per thousand cubic feet  just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter  there was a dip in the fall  but then prices rebounded  by early november  prices were at  5 per thousand cubic feet  the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher  but  10 gas was coming  below normal temperatures hit much of the country  including the kansas city area  and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets   it s all about the weather   said krapels of energy security analysis  wholesale prices exploded to  10 per thousand cubic feet  led by the new york traders  natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price volatile commodity in the world  setting the price in the 1980s  the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas  allowing it to float  in 1990  the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas  and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices  the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years  suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce  and big gas consumers  from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc   can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use  there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas    and often with little real knowledge of natural gas  but if they get on the right side of a price trend  traders don t need to know much about gas    or whatever commodity they re trading  like all futures  the gas contracts are purchased on credit  that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders  ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time  as december began  the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than  7 per thousand cubic feet  by the end of the month it was nearly  10  much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association s weekly storage numbers  utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter  going into the winter  the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average  in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing  in hopes that the summer s unusually high  4 to  5 prices would drop  still  the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient  but when below normal temperatures arrived in november  the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient  then the american gas association reported the lowest year end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994  still  said the association s mcgill  there was sufficient gas in storage  but some utility executives didn t share that view  william eliason  vice president of kansas gas service  said that if december s cold snap had continued into january  there could have been a real problem meeting demand   i was getting worried   he said  then suddenly the market turned when january s weather turned warmer  wednesday s storage numbers were better than expected  and futures prices dropped more than  1 per thousand cubic feet  just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers  among area utilities  kansas gas service increased its customers  cost of gas charge earlier this month to  8 68 per thousand cubic feet  and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to  9 81  to begin wednesday  sheila lumpe  chairwoman of the missouri public service commission  said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs  little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level payment plan and to conserve energy  kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place  which is expected to save an average customer about  25 this winter  missouri gas energy has no hedging program  it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when

1560,2, george  i am back in the office and ready to focus on the project   i still have the concerns that i had last week   specifically that the costs of our project are too high   i have gathered more information that support my concerns   based on my research  i believe the project should cost around  10 5 million   the components are as follows  unit cost  site work    builders profit  52 sf               7 6 million land                      1 15 interim financing                85 common areas                      80 total                          10 4 since reagan s last 12 units are selling for around  190 000  i am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over  95 000 unit in costs  also  the comps used in the appraisal from austin appear to be class a properties   it seems unlikely that student housing in san marcos can produce the same rent or sales price   there should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property   i recognize that sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and   foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas  however  we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis  supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance  after the real estate expert from houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates  his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic   he feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around  9 8 million   we would not even be able to cover the interim financing  keith and i have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above  10 5 million    we would like to have a conference call tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives  phillip

1580,2, liane  as we discussed yesterday  i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index   a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices   4 70  4 80  for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index   at the time of these trades  offers for physical gas at significantly  10 to 15 cents  lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation   additionally  these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan  we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27   these are the complete list of trades from enron online  eol   enron s direct phone conversations  and three brokerage firms  amerex  apb  and prebon    please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary   we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships   the two key points from this data are as follows  1   the high physical prices on the 26th   27th  4 75 4 80  are much greater than the high financial trades  4 6375 4 665  on those days  2   the spread relationship between san juan and other points  socal   northwest   is  consistent between the end of september and october gas daily   it doesn t make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different  i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers   hopefully  the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4 70 s and these trades are outliers   i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index   it is enron s belief that the trades at  4 70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index  it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business   please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal  sincerely  phillip allen

1590,2, questions about 12 29 rentroll  there were two deposits that were not labeled   one for  150 and the other for  75   which apartments   20a or  13  utility overages for  26 and  44   where did you get these amounts   for what periods   what is going on with  42    do not evict this tenant for being unclean    that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling   i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes   if that doesn t work  we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor   then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property   this tenant has been here since september 1998  i don t want to run them off  i check with the bank and i did not see that a deposit was made on tuesday so i couldn t check the total from the rentroll against the bank   is this right   has the deposit been made yet  a rentroll for jan 5th will follow shortly  phillip

ect ect  suresh vasan enron communications enron communications enron cc  subject  internet data gain is a major power drain on local utilities   september 05  2000   in 1997  a little known silicon valley company called exodus communications opened a 15 000 square foot data center in tukwila  the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the region s growing number of dot coms  fast forward to summer 2000  exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new 13 acre  576 000 square foot data center less than a mile from its original facility  sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones  the exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house internet servers for firms such as avenue a  microsoft and onvia com  exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle  more than a dozen companies    with names like abovenet  globix and hostpro    are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the internet economy  it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites  data centers  also known as co location facilities and server farms  are sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24 hour  high security facilities   we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall   said karl karzmar  manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy   that is the equivalent of six oil refineries   a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business  the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads  puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers  the tariff is designed to protect the company s existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects  those base stations could cost as much as  20 million each  karzmar said  not to be left behind  seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting  for the utilities that provide power to homes  businesses and schools in the region  this is a new and complex issue  on one hand  the data centers    with their amazing appetite for power    represent potentially lucrative business customers  the facilities run 24 hours a day  seven days a week  and therefore could become a constant revenue stream  on the other hand  they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures  who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate   these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads   said bob royer  director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light   the entire university of washington  from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school  averages 31 megawatts per day  we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30  40 and 50 megawatts   with more than 1 5 million square feet  the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers  sabey corp  re purchased the 1 35 million square foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space   defense  in less than 12 months  the developer has leased 92 percent of the six building complex to seven different co location companies   it is probably the largest data center park in the country   boasts laurent poole  chief operating officer at sabey  exodus  icg communications  netstream communications  pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park  after building exodus  first tukwila facility in 1997  sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles  spokane and denver  poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country  as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth heavy tasks such as listening to online music  poole said the need for co location space in seattle continues to escalate  but it is not just seattle  the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country  causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california  exodus  one of the largest providers of co location space  plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year  while companies such as amazon com run their own server farms  many high tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management   we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months   yet there is more demand right now than data center space   said steve porter  an account executive at exodus in seattle  the booming market for co location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed   it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth   said seattle city light s royer   the utility industry is almost stunned by this  in a way

legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th  having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would  eat  the  5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund  thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  8 billion   however  the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession   sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis  including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated  before they will support the bond issuance to go forward  currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan  ab 8x and ab 31x   ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  10 billion in bonds   this bill passed the senate in march  but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support   ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts   however  sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen  currently in ab 8x   senator  bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments  which  if passed  would be likely to cause a socal  bankruptcy    according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund   for instance  tony  strickland has stated that only 1 2 of the bonds  or approximately  5 billion   should be issued  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds   the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  monday   additionally  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan   key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount   4 125 b lenders   jp morgan   2 5 b lehman brothers   1 0 b bear stearns   625 m tax exempt portion  of the  4 125 b   1 6 b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate  taxable rate  5 77  tax exempt rate  4 77  current projected blended ir   5 38  maturity date   august 29  2001 for more details please contact me at  713  853 9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday  but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday  which authorizes  5  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation  authority     the  5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the  5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased  or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward   again  the republicans are not in support of these authorizations   without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has  negotiated  the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support    no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power     also  there is no staff  defined purpose  etc  for the california public power and conservation authority   however  this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates  who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis   socal edison and bankruptcy at this point  two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy   the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor   the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th  however  some decision will likely be made earlier   according to sources  the state has yet to sign the mou with socal  though socal has signed it   the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass   if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou  socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy  or its creditor   involuntary  due to the lack operating cash  the second likely triggering event  which is linked directly to the bond issuance  would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x  bridge loan  stating that the dwr would received 100  of its payments from ratepayers  then the utilities would receive the residual amount   in other words  the state will get paid before the utilities   if this language is included and passed by the legislature  it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy   socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments

to  cbpres austin rr com  to   phillip allen   pallen enron com  cc   larry lewter   retwell mail sanmarcos net    claudia l  crocker   clclegal2 aol com  subject  investment structure structure  typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate  or llc  general partner   the general partner owns 1  of the project and carries the liability of construction  land ownership   loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans  land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership   each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans   if the investor s  do not sign on the loans  this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced  all loans for residential construction  that are intended for re sale  are full recourse loans   if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments  the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit  engineering   architectural design  soils tests  surveys  filing fees  legal fees for organization and condominium association formation   and appraisals   unlike many real estate investment programs  none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders  llc   these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period  early land costs the  4 000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing   as an alternative  we can close into a land loan at probably 70  of appraised value   with a land value equal to the purchase price of  680 000 this would mean a land loan of  476 000 with estimated monthly interest payments of  3 966  given a 10  annual interest rate  plus approximately 1 25  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin  the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements  referred to as the  fiscals    this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa   this release will be for 90  of the cost with the remaining 10  released one year after completion   releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction   these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit   as such  they have to be counted as a development cost  even though they are not spent   because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds  the lot improvement loan is typically 75  of the appraised value of a finished lot  which i suspect will be at least  20 000 and potentially as high as  25 000   this would produce a loan amount of   15 000 on  20 000 per lot   with estimated per lot improvement costs of  9 000   fiscals  at  2 000 and the land cost at  8 000   total improved lot cost is  19 000 which means  0 to  4 000 per lot in total equity   the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs   thus  the additional equity for the improvement loan would be  0  184 000    even if the maximum loan would cover all costs  it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side   the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing  which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement  phasing works as follows   if the first phase was say 40 units  the total lot improvement cost might average  31 000 per lot    of this  probably  13 000 would be for improvements and  19 000 for the land cost   the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs  the entry road  water treatment costs  perimeter fencing and landscaping  and so on  as well as for 100  of the land   the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70  of the appraised raw lot value  which i would estimate as  10 000 per lot for a loan value of  7 000 per lot   then the loan value for each improved lot would be  15 000 per lot   this would give you a total loan of  992 000  total cost of  1 232 645 for equity required of  241 000   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans   first  is a speculative  spec  loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity   second   is a construction loan for a pre sold unit  but the loan remains in the builder developers name   third  is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer   we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer   we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers  as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process  spec loans will be for 70  to 75  of value and construction loans for pre sold units  if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender   will be from 80  to 95  of value  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs  then to necessary reserves  then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement   the general partner will contract with creekside builders  llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15  of the direct hard cost excluding land  financing and sales costs  these fees are the only monies to creekside  larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit  except for a  direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b  direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform   for example  if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub  or cannot find enough trim carpenters  etc   and it decides to undertake this function  it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership  finally  cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others   at present cb does not own any significant equipment  but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing  cornice  roofing and drywall spreading  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs  plan  what did you have in mind   i would like to use some form of internet based reporting  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question   bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses    please expand  investor input we are glad to have the investor s input on design and materials   as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement  but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus  as you  and i presume keith  want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs  vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates   in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible   for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport   finally  for vendors they are constantly shopped  pre selected professionals  subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested  i know i have not answered everything  but this is a starting point   call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further  sincerely  george richards president  creekside builders  llc   winmail dat

1927,2, george  here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit   check my math  but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation   at permanent financing  1 1 would be paid  leaving only  3 to pay out in the 1st year  since almost 80  of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment  i feel the 65 35 is a fair split   however  as i mentioned earlier  i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract  just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas  1   fixed construction profit of  1 4 million   builder doesn t benefit from higher cost  rather suffers as an equity holder  2    5  equity for meeting time and costs in original plan   51 sq ft  phase 1 complete in november   5  equity for under budget and ahead of schedule  5  equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60 40  but could be as favorable as 55 45   i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon  feel free to call me at home  713 463 8626 phillip

2030,2, traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip  especially if you have to prepare a presentation   i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings   i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary  as far as the business meetings  i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not   too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn    the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format  my suggestion for where to go is austin   play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s   flying somewhere takes too much time

originally published wednesday  los angeles  dow jones   the california independent system operator paid about  10 million wednesday for 1 000 megawatts of power from powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state  high ranking market sources familiar with the iso s operation told dow jones newswires  but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day  the iso wouldn t comment on the transactions  saying it is sensitive market information  but sources said powerex  a subsidiary of british columbia hydro   power authority  x bch   is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about  900 a megawatt hour from the early afternoon through the evening  but that still wasn t enough juice  the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso 1 200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of  250 mwh  the ladwp  which is not governed by the iso  needs 3 800 megawatts of power to serve its customers  it is free sell power instate above the  250 mwh price cap  the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare  the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high  however  the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging  the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration  which sells hydropower at cheap rates  back into the market at prices 10 times higher  powerex officials wouldn t comment on the iso power sale  saying all transactions are proprietary  but the company also sold the iso 1 000 megawatts tuesday   minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts   for  1 100 a megawatt hour  market sources said  the iso  whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost  started the day with a stage two power emergency  which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5   the iso is having to compete with investor owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps  the iso warned federal regulators  generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage three power emergency wednesday  but wouldn t order rolling blackouts  a stage three is declared when the iso s operating reserves fall to less than 1 5  and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing  but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources   in order to line up  more power  we have to be in a dire situation   dorinson said  edison international unit  eix  southern california edison  sempra energy unit  sre  san diego gas   electric  pg e corp   pcg  unit pacific gas   electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high priced power  socal edison and pg e are facing a debt of more than  6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs  the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly  1 billion  analysts said  it s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs   by jason leopold  dow jones newswires  323 658 3874  jason leopold dowjones com  end  dow jones newswires 07 12 00

calif   wednesday morning  a duke spokesman said  the iso and puc have been inspecting all off line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are  iso spokesman pat dorinson said  about 11 000 mw of power has been off the state s power grid since monday  7 000 mw of which is off line for unplanned maintenance  according to the iso  the iso manages grid reliability  as previously reported  the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 pm pst  0100 gmt thursday   meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1 5  and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse  however  the iso said the action wouldn t result in rolling blackouts  the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc  dyn   reliant energy inc   rei  and southern energy inc  soe   duke s 1 500 mw moss landing

officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons  the california independent system operator  which manages the state s power grid and one of its wholesale power markets  and the california public utilities commission began on site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns  iso spokesman pat dorinson said  the state has had 11 000 mw off the grid since monday  7 000 mw for unplanned maintenance  the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day  meaning power reserves were below 5  and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so  as reported earlier  reliant energy  rei  and southern energy inc   soe  said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening  representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening  aes told the visitors they couldn t perform an unannounced full inspection of the company s 450 megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning  when the plant s full staff would be present  aes spokesman aaron thomas said  thomas  as well as an iso spokesman  didn t know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection  aes units down due to expired emissions credits the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide  or nox  emission credits  they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed  thomas said  aes has about 2 000 mw  or half its maximum output  off line  the entire huntington plant is off line  as is 1 500 mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants  the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations  but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company  20 million for polluting   we d be happy to put our units back  provided we don t get sued for it   thomas said   it s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district s  authority  as reported  a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies  but choose not to do so  dynegy s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc   dyn  said the puc visited its 1 200 mw el segundo plant tuesday evening  where two of the four units  about 600 mw worth  were off line wednesday   i guess our position is   gee  we re sorry you don t believe us  but if you need to come and take a look for yourself  that s fine    said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky  lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps  which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired   we ve been doing all we can to get back in service   lednicky said   we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited   lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy s explanation of why its units were off line   by jessica berthold  dow jones newswires  323 658 3872  jessica berthold dowjones com  end  dow

to  cbpres austin rr com  to   phillip allen   pallen enron com  cc   larry lewter   retwell mail sanmarcos net    claudia l  crocker   clclegal2 aol com  subject  investment structure structure  typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate  or llc  general partner   the general partner owns 1  of the project and carries the liability of construction  land ownership   loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans  land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership   each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans   if the investor s  do not sign on the loans  this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced  all loans for residential construction  that are intended for re sale  are full recourse loans   if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments  the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit  engineering   architectural design  soils tests  surveys  filing fees  legal fees for organization and condominium association formation   and appraisals   unlike many real estate investment programs  none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders  llc   these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period  early land costs the  4 000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing   as an alternative  we can close into a land loan at probably 70  of appraised value   with a land value equal to the purchase price of  680 000 this would mean a land loan of  476 000 with estimated monthly interest payments of  3 966  given a 10  annual interest rate  plus approximately 1 25  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin  the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements  referred to as the  fiscals    this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa   this release will be for 90  of the cost with the remaining 10  released one year after completion   releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction   these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit   as such  they have to be counted as a development cost  even though they are not spent   because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds  the lot improvement loan is typically 75  of the appraised value of a finished lot  which i suspect will be at least  20 000 and potentially as high as  25 000   this would produce a loan amount of   15 000 on  20 000 per lot   with estimated per lot improvement costs of  9 000   fiscals  at  2 000 and the land cost at  8 000   total improved lot cost is  19 000 which means  0 to  4 000 per lot in total equity   the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs   thus  the additional equity for the improvement loan would be  0  184 000    even if the maximum loan would cover all costs  it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side   the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing  which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement  phasing works as follows   if the first phase was say 40 units  the total lot improvement cost might average  31 000 per lot    of this  probably  13 000 would be for improvements and  19 000 for the land cost   the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs  the entry road  water treatment costs  perimeter fencing and landscaping  and so on  as well as for 100  of the land   the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70  of the appraised raw lot value  which i would estimate as  10 000 per lot for a loan value of  7 000 per lot   then the loan value for each improved lot would be  15 000 per lot   this would give you a total loan of  992 000  total cost of  1 232 645 for equity required of  241 000   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans   first  is a speculative  spec  loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity   second   is a construction loan for a pre sold unit  but the loan remains in the builder developers name   third  is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer   we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer   we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers  as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process  spec loans will be for 70  to 75  of value and construction loans for pre sold units  if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender   will be from 80  to 95  of value  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs  then to necessary reserves  then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement   the general partner will contract with creekside builders  llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15  of the direct hard cost excluding land  financing and sales costs  these fees are the only monies to creekside  larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit  except for a  direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b  direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform   for example  if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub  or cannot find enough trim carpenters  etc   and it decides to undertake this function  it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership  finally  cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others   at present cb does not own any significant equipment  but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing  cornice  roofing and drywall spreading  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs  plan  what did you have in mind   i would like to use some form of internet based reporting  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question   bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses    please expand  investor input we are glad to have the investor s input on design and materials   as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement  but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus  as you  and i presume keith  want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs  vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates   in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible   for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport   finally  for vendors they are constantly shopped  pre selected professionals  subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested  i know i have not answered everything  but this is a starting point   call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further  sincerely  george richards president  creekside builders  llc   winmail dat

joe hartsoe corp enron enron  mark palmer corp enron enron  karen denne corp enron enron cc  subject  meeting with governor davis  need for additional comments suggestions we met with gov davis on thursday evening in la   in attendance were ken lay  the governor  the governor s staff director  kari dohn  and myself   the gov  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas   he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday  attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed  based on my discussions with several of you  as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared   below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals  the governor s ideas  as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor s comments  overview    we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration  the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief  more modest than what the utilities are looking for  and credit guarantees   his staff has more work to do on the latter  but he was clearly intrigued with the idea   he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level   he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers  including utility owned generation  which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost plus basis  and excess muni power  which he estimates at 3000mw    he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by  02 and provide some political cover  our proposals   i have attached the outline we put in front of him  it also included the forward price information several of you provided    he seemed interested in 1  the buy down of significant demand  2  the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain  3  getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4  setting up a group of rate analysts and other  nonadvocates  to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities  he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases    as already mentioned  he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities  his ideas   the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere  brainstorming   some of these ideas would require legislative action  state may build  or make build transfer arrangements  a  couple  of generation plants   the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases   this was a frequently recurring theme  utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost plus basis to consumers  municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california  state universities  including uc csu and the community colleges  would more widely deploy distributed generation  expand in state gas production  take state lands gas royalties in kind  negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies  empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time  condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state  either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function    he wants to hear more about how nordpool works jeff  someone in schroeder s group should be able to help out here   wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state   we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators  securitize uncollected power purchase costs  to dos   jeff  again i d like to prevail on you to assemble the group s thoughts and get them to kari  he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak  off peak and baseload    not just the 5 one year strips  he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday  he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal  he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues  thanks to everyone for their help   we made some progress today

a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may 8th deadline    any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart   according to sources  both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis   the democratic caucus is reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis   many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that  once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund  davis would  double dip  into the fund   clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor   however  it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated  a bond issuance will take place  additionally  some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts  as opposed to those still in development  require that the bond issuance happen by july 1  2001   if not  the state may be in breach of contract   sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th  having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would  eat  the  5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund  thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  8 billion   however  the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession   sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis  including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated  before they will support the bond issuance to go forward  currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan  ab 8x and ab 31x   ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  10 billion in bonds   this bill passed the senate in march  but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support   ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts   however  sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen  currently in ab 8x   senator  bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments  which  if passed  would be likely to cause a socal  bankruptcy    according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund   for instance  tony  strickland has stated that only 1 2 of the bonds  or approximately  5 billion   should be issued  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds   the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  monday   additionally  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan   key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount   4 125 b lenders   jp morgan   2 5 b lehman brothers   1 0 b bear stearns   625 m tax exempt portion  of the  4 125 b   1 6 b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate  taxable rate  5 77  tax exempt rate  4 77  current projected blended ir   5 38  maturity date   august 29  2001 for more details please contact me at  713  853 9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday  but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday  which authorizes  5  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation  authority     the  5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the  5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased  or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward   again  the republicans are not in support of these authorizations   without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has  negotiated  the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support    no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power     also  there is no staff  defined purpose  etc  for the california public power and conservation authority   however  this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates  who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis   socal edison and bankruptcy at this point  two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy   the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor   the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th  however  some decision will likely be made earlier   according to sources  the state has yet to sign the mou with socal  though socal has signed it   the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass   if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou  socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy  or its creditor   involuntary  due to the lack operating cash  the second likely triggering event  which is linked directly to the bond issuance  would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x  bridge loan  stating that the dwr would received 100  of its payments from ratepayers  then the utilities would receive the residual amount   in other words  the state will get paid before the utilities   if this language is included and passed by the legislature  it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy   socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments

2368,2, liane  as we discussed yesterday  i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index   a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices   4 70  4 80  for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index   at the time of these trades  offers for physical gas at significantly  10 to 15 cents  lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation   additionally  these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan  we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27   these are the complete list of trades from enron online  eol   enron s direct phone conversations  and three brokerage firms  amerex  apb  and prebon    please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary   we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships   the two key points from this data are as follows  1   the high physical prices on the 26th   27th  4 75 4 80  are much greater than the high financial trades  4 6375 4 665  on those days  2   the spread relationship between san juan and other points  socal   northwest   is  consistent between the end of september and october gas daily   it doesn t make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different  i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers   hopefully  the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4 70 s and these trades are outliers   i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index   it is enron s belief that the trades at  4 70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index  it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business   please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal  sincerely  phillip allen

received by leth exceed  150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi  millions to the bottom line  leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy   an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market   mar 9  04  urgent news update  leth announces the sale of two  2  biosphere process systems to procura international limited for  14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months  solving a dual crisis  waste and energy  leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem  this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean   green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste   agricultural wastes   forestry wastes   medical wastes   industrial wastes   sewage sludge   shale oil   sour natural gas   and the huge market of used tires  leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega  watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid   mar 3  04  leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of  3  5 million   the equivalent of  12 cents per share  leth is scheduled to receive an additional  7 million translating into an additional  24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months  the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above  6 by

ordered   which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over  100 million in upcoming sales  many of these contractual agreements include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the future once the initial order has been completed  the options vary from hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this low  float   emerging industry leader at an average sale price of  7 million per biosphere process system  leth  s blue chip partner  fortifying the system  leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech   inc   nasdaq  ttek    20  a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental   mechanical   and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of  800 million  tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits   installation   and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth  tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana  this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near  term announcement  stock set to explode on earnings boom  leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record  setting stock price levels in support of the company  s breakout year  the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year  we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come  there aren  t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth   while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to

industry sectors for the past year are energy related  but it  s in the mid  sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi   mogi  that the biggest gains are being made  in the last 12 months   many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns  breaking news   april 29    montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project  after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta   the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5  3  38  3 w 5 m well  the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after  the company  s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban  with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description  project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950  s and has produced over 40 million barrels  mbbls  of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet  bcf  of associated natural gas   predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations  the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics  the original freehold lease on section 3  38  3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company   as was most of the sylvan lake field itself  an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7  3  38  3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting  as a consequence   the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights  below the base of the jurassic formations  on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960  s  this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically   not often by the major companies  accordingly   these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000  s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee  through diligent land work  including field visits  our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3  since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres  one quarter section  of section 3  energy 51 has the right to earn 50  of this prospect  possibly 75   with the drilling of a test well in 5  3  38  3 w 5 m  land discussion our partners have secured a 100  working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3  38  3 w 5 m  the land comprises some 480 acres  one section or one square mile equals 640 acres   primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows  one quarter section spacing  160 acres  for oil and one section spacing  640 acres  for natural gas  the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units  called holdings  should you be able to prove to the province  s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density  almost the entire sylvan lake field   pekisko pool   has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well  geological discussion pekisko formation   the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper  older  pekisko formation  the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation  this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions  overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks  impermeable layers  of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous  jurassic impermeable shales  these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves  production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty  five years  accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed  a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location  the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf  d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf  d  accordingly   excess capacity of 24 mmcf  d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible  this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation
